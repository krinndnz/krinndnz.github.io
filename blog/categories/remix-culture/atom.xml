    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was reminded of the classic template criticizing <a href="http://craphound.com/spamsolutions.txt">attempts to curb spam</a>,
a quiet little text file on Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s site, by my attempts to find the
<a href="http://secretvolcanobase.org/~tef/distributed_social_networks.txt">version about social networks</a>. It turns out there are quite a few
snowclones of this, and since I&rsquo;m a kitty who adores remix culture, I decided to try to find a few
more.</p>

<p>There are a few, and I&rsquo;d love to be made aware of more. Things that so far will not work:</p>

<p>I love how, at best, the form is a way to make critical thinking cheaper. Of course it may also
fail to do that&mdash;but on a good day, it&rsquo;s a way to repudiate bad ideas by contextualizing them, by
adding relevant information instead of by shouting. Snowcloning it into different contexts is also
at a sweet-spot difficulty level: easy enough to be tempting, but hard enough to be a bit of
serious work worth respecting. It&rsquo;s a great way to summarize &ldquo;here is the bar to entry for new
techniques, this problem is in fact hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another amusing thing is how often the &ldquo;Asshats&rdquo; and &ldquo;No-one will be able to find the guy or
collect the money&rdquo; objections appear verbatim. Some things cross many, many fields of human
endeavour.</p>

<p>For bonus points, here&rsquo;s someone making an interesting argument that the original form was wrong,
<a href="http://blog.jwhitham.org/2013/05/users-of-email-will-not-put-up-with-it.html">&ldquo;Users Of Email Will Not Stand For It&rdquo;</a>, and a MetaFilter user who claims to have come
up with <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/122211/technical-legislative-marketbased-vigilante#1751153">the original</a>.</p>

<p>This is a nifty video of a musical robot&mdash;but it&rsquo;s also a great example of how all culture builds
on what came before, how all culture is to some extent remix culture. It&rsquo;s a robot that physically
plays a set of instruments that correspond to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808">TR-808</a>, which itself was a way of synthetically
producing the sounds of that set of instruments. Always we are consuming what came before;
sometimes we are making it our own and new, and ideally we are giving it freely to a future that
needs it just as badly as we need our own past.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time tinkering with computers, it&rsquo;s one of the big themes in my life. I have a
pretty well-grounded idea of what computers are capable of and what they&rsquo;re not&mdash;which is why this
compilation of people treating computers as magic entertains me so much. Of course as a writer I
also appreciate that sometimes you just need magic to get the characters from point A to point B,
so I don&rsquo;t hold it against them. Also, props to the author for assembling these clips with
expertise and transformative execution: the new work speaks in a way that the components
didn&rsquo;t. Well done.</p>

<p>Every day is repost day, all culture is on some level remix culture.</p>
