<blockquote><p>here are some avatars i was commissioned to create for the gaymerconnect forums. a friend of mine
suggested that the existing avatars that users had to choose from all skewed male&mdash;androgynous
male, yeah, but as a trans woman she wasnâ€™t comfortable wearing that as an avatar. so, i tried to
fill in the blanks with a bunch of feminine, femme and genderqueer identities.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really like where Pixelante went with this&mdash;this is some actual visual diversity here. Make sure
to check out the rest at the linked page!</p>

<p>Self-representation in digital media is an ongoing and open problem: I don&rsquo;t expect it to ever be
<em>solved</em> any more than the broader question of identity, but it&rsquo;s got an openness to
experimentation in ways that weren&rsquo;t possible before, and I find that very appealing. It&rsquo;s also
worked out very well for me personally: I wouldn&rsquo;t be the kitty I am if not for the potential
offered by digital media.</p>
