    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>You already have permission</p>

<p>Just saying</p>

<p>You have permission to create, to speak up, and stand up</p>

<p>You have permission to be generous, to fail, and to be vulnerable</p>

<p>You have permission to own your words, to matter and to help</p>

<p>No need to wait.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seth Godin is an ongoing source of inspiration to me. I have a nasty love-hate relationship with
advertising, but Godin does a great job of making me feel inspired about the great work of
persuasion. He&rsquo;s like the Scott McCloud of it: in the same way as re-reading McCloud&rsquo;s comics
trilogy makes me wave my hands and shout &ldquo;hooray comics!&rdquo;, Godin&rsquo;s work energizes me. He is also an
interesting kind of optimist: his work generally assumes that <em>you already have good ideas.</em> You
do. The challenge is turning good ideas into great ideas, which takes a lot of work, and persuading
others that your idea is great, which also takes a lot of work. But with Godin as my cheerleader, I
feel equipped to take that work on.</p>
