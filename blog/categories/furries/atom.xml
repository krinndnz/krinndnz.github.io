    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good <a href="news:">news:</a> a judge pushing back against hate-your-sex-life obscenity laws!</p>

<p>Better <a href="news:">news:</a> by reading werewolf porn and deciding &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s not so bad&rdquo;!</p>

<p>The Atlantic Wire reports, in an article that you will not regret reading:</p>

<blockquote><p>Andres Martinez, serving time for attempted murder and robbery at the Secured Housing Unit at
Pelican Bay State Prison in California, is free to read his werewolf-human erotica novel,
according to a decision handed down by the First District Court of Appeal. [&hellip;] prison officials
confiscated the book, calling it obscene, because it contains sexually explicit passages and
&ldquo;advocates violence.&rdquo; [&hellip;] The case also pushes back on obscenity standards in its analysis of
the value of the overall text, making it more difficult to label a written work as obscene. In
short, more justices might have to read, think about, and write opinions on werewolf erotica.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am in favor of basically all of this, as a reader and writer of werewolf smut. :D</p>
