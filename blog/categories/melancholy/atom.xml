    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. <br>

He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. <br>

For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. <br>

Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; <br>

Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. <br>

But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</blockquote>


<p>There are many things to dislike about the Book of Job, but at its best, it is a deeply poignant cry of pain about the human condition.</p>
