    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
Does it imagine? Does it dream, or feel?<br>
It dreamed it was a falcon; it did not<br>
return to its perch. It snapped the tethering line.<br>
Its once-bound eczemantic ankle healed.<br>
Unhooded, it could not remember what<br>
it had been when waking. Banking now, it climbs<br>
the upward-drafting, dessicated air.<br>
The falconer grows smaller, disappears.<br>
The late sun is huge. The Hindu Kush<br>
grow a long beard of shadow. A dark pair<br>
of murine eyes gauges its passing. Here<br>
and there small bands of village farmers push<br>
their lowing beasts and plows without a word,<br>
and do not fear, nor note, the spiraling bird.<br>
</blockquote>


<p>The Man Who Was IOZ&rsquo;s poetry is sometimes on the gnomic side. This once, just to nudge folks in the
right direction, is riffing on &ldquo;turning and turning in the widening gyre, the falcon cannot hear
the falconer&rdquo; and is tagged <code>drones</code>. Shaln&rsquo;t say more: overexplaining a thing is perilous.</p>
