    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;d like to use the Internet controversy of the week &mdash; particularly,
<a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2013/03/adria-richards-does-belong-at-tech.html">Melissa McEwan&rsquo;s response</a> to it &mdash; to talk about something that&rsquo;s been on my mind for a while: escalation. I believe that the changes in our communications environment, particularly mass access to broadcast-style media and the possibility of things &ldquo;going viral,&rdquo; have made it very easy to escalate problems, and that people should invest more thought and caution into a decision to escalate, and should have better de-escalation toolkits.</p>

<p>To vastly, vastly oversimplify, <a href="https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/">the incident that people are talking about</a> went like so: at PyCon, a developer conference, two dudes were cracking dick jokes, a woman sitting near them posted a picture of them to Twitter with a &ldquo;not cool, stop that&rdquo; message, an escalation spiral occurred, and all three of the people involved got fired. There&rsquo;s lots to read about this incident, but I&rsquo;m going to pick on a micro slice of it: the decision to publicly shame people instead of speaking to them &mdash; that is, the decision to escalate.</p>

<p>Escalation is part of our communication/relationship/group-interaction toolkit; I will not say that it is a bad thing. What I will say is that it is a tool that&rsquo;s good for some things, but not for others, and that it is a tool that you should handle with the same caution that you give to, say, a power sander. It should never be a tool of first resort &mdash; but it should never be a tool that is denied to people.</p>

<p>As a working definition of escalation, let&rsquo;s consider &ldquo;expanding the scope of a conflict.&rdquo; One easy example is <em>ad hominem</em> attacks: when the argument expands from being about proposals to also being about the personal characteristics of one or more participants. Another example is the fallacy with the charming name of <em>argumentum ad baculum</em> &mdash; the appeal to force. When someone demands that they prevail in an argument because of force rather than reason, they have escalated that argument. We can consider also the incident in which Rob Schneider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuce_Bigalow:_European_Gigolo#Reception">responded to a negative review</a> of a movie that he starred in by taking out a full-page ad to respond denigrating the critic. When a disagreement may be public or private, and someone chooses to move into the public sphere, they have escalated that disagreement.</p>

<p>The reason that escalation is a useful and problematic tool is that all of these things <em>change people&rsquo;s responses.</em> Expanding the scope of a conflict puts it in a different context, related to the new scope, and that context informs people&rsquo;s responses. This is emphatically not the same as &ldquo;puts people on their best behavior.&rdquo; Focusing on the case of escalating a private disagreement to the public sphere, it should be very clear that people act differently in public and in private. This is where we encounter the effects of changes in our communication environment: it&rsquo;s as easy as it ever was to escalate arguments by insults or by force, but it used to be much more difficult to make a dispute public. Someone fluent with the Internet&rsquo;s communications affordances can make something public very quickly indeed, and with the cooperation of others, it can be made very, very public.</p>

<p>This is dangerous; <strong>escalation is not always a good idea.</strong> Escalation is usually a sign of &ldquo;the terms on which this conflict is being conducted, are unfavorable to me, so I&rsquo;m going to change them.&rdquo; Escalation occurs in a social context. Escalation is very easy now, and will not become less easy with the communications environment we&rsquo;ve chosen for ourselves, so we have to develop a &ldquo;social technology&rdquo; that tells people when it&rsquo;s appropriate to escalate. As the the PyCon incident illustrates, very often <a href="https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/">escalation results in everyone losing</a>, like a mutual-betrayal scenario in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a>.</p>

<p>I am not going to attempt to give comprehensive advice about when to escalate: part of why escalation is a tricky technique is that it&rsquo;s quite difficult to decide when to escalate. What I am going to do, is to urge you to think carefully before escalating, and to never escalate just because it&rsquo;s easy to escalate. We are all prone to human failures of thought that are very likely to happen when something goes from public to private, and which things like Twitter give us plenty of room to indulge. Good Guys and Bad Guys will be assigned, regardless of whether the debate at hand admits the existence of clear-cut Good and Bad. People will dig in their heels when they are arguing in front of people whose goodwill they value: they will be less likely to back down. People not previously involved in the argument will <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2008/10/08/false-witnesses-2/">feel compelled to weigh in and establish that they are on the side of Right and Good and Truth</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes people prone to escalation, is a failure to identify the urgency of a situation. False urgency drives us all to make bad decisions; it is a specific flavor of fear. It can be overcome, but it takes effort, and one&rsquo;s personal life is generally better when it contains as few people as possible who are prone to identifying the non-urgent as urgent. People who feel safe, confident, and at ease, rarely escalate, which is part of why I think that those things should be afforded to everyone. On the flip side, people who feel threatened, insecure, and agitated, are prone to escalation.</p>

<p>One thing that I think is a very clever use of escalation&rsquo;s virtues is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holla_Back">Holla Back</a> inititative. It correctly identifies that a particular argument is unwinnable in its &ldquo;native&rdquo; context (i.e. &ldquo;street harassment is fine&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fucking harass people&rdquo;) and shifts the context. It takes advantage of the difference between what people will do in anonymous crowds, and what they are willing to be held accountable for. It evades difficulties of escalation because there is rarely an existing social bond between harassers and victims in this context. It&rsquo;s a very deft use of escalation: it specifically says &ldquo;here is a situation where escalation is an appropriate response, and here are tools to make it easy and a social framing to make it acceptable.&rdquo; All of the components there are important: escalation isn&rsquo;t always an appropriate response, and independently, it&rsquo;s not always socially acceptable.</p>

<p>If you read the <a href="http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/">first-person account</a> of Adria Richards, the woman who reported the PyCon incident, it seems like she&rsquo;s pretty clearly basing her response on the Holla Back model. It did not work out well. This illustrates a further difficulty of escalation: it invites escalation in return, and de-escalation is almost always more difficult than escalation. Escalation&rsquo;s expansion of scope requires an expansion of commitment &mdash; even if a participant feels like they have not become more committed, if they are still in the argument, they&rsquo;re committed to a bigger argument. In this case, the public nature of the argument drew in other participants, who escalated (e.g. by firing people) and comments from the peanut gallery (some awful, awful Reddit/Hacker News threads on the matter). It is a good illustration of the dangers of escalation.</p>

<p>Escalation is only a tool. Like a hammer, it is good at some things, bad at others, and in the process of using it for either you may hurt yourself by using it inexpertly. In your own life, I urge you to reject false urgency, to never use escalation as a first resort, and to critically examine any conflict you&rsquo;re involved in for attempts to escalate it without your consent.</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit: I disavow the view that Adria Richards <em>should</em> have acted differently: the whole point of this spiel is that escalation is hard. If I said that or seemed to say that, I was wrong, I wanted to address escalation as a phenomenon, not her in particular. About her case in particular, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2013/03/22/why-asking-what-adria-richards-could-have-done-differently-is-the-wrong-question/">Deanna Zandt</a> has a great writeup with links to other insightful pieces.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter yanked TweetDeck out of Natasha Lockheart&rsquo;s hands, and she&rsquo;s unhappy about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Where does a person go to be truly social on the internet? This is a question I find
myself asking all too often, and once I settle in somewhere, I seem to have to find
somewhere else to go. Today, Twitter announced that they were pulling all non-web-based
versions of Tweetdeck, and in doing so, they will no longer function after May of this year.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t very fond of TweetDeck, myself: I thought that the multi-network functionality was the best thing it had going for it, and since I despise Facebook and think LinkedIn is dubious, that wasn&rsquo;t exactly a win for me. On top of that, it&rsquo;s been obvious for a while that <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/twitter-is-pivoting">Twitter is pivoting</a> &mdash; that they are not interested in being &ldquo;good&rdquo; as Natasha and I define &ldquo;good.&rdquo; First they <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/16/twitter-drop-dead">told developers where to shove it</a>, then they changed the experience for the top tier of users. As Dustin Curtis points out, &ldquo;people on Facebook tend to friend their friends, <a href="http://dcurt.is/twitters-graph">people on Twitter tend to follow their interests</a>,&rdquo; making it a communications stream that&rsquo;s more appealing to advertisers than most Facebook chatter. Twitter is pretty clearly not interested in the opinions of users who want a Twitter that they <em>interact</em> with. If you can think like a pointy-haired boss for a minute, it follows pretty clearly: people who want to interact with the service are pushy, demanding, and far less profitable than people who just <em>consume</em> the service. As a result, Twitter is going to continue turning into television (“<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/">this is the moment in Twitter’s life where they kicked Steve Jobs out of the company and told Sculley to run it.</a>”)</p>

<p>I consider it firmly established that Twitter is not interested in being what my tribe wants it to be. Given that, the most likely scenario for the future is that Twitter will suck &mdash; for my tribe, that is; it&rsquo;s entirely possible that at the same time they will make a ton of money and stabilize with hundreds of millions of users. This is sad, but not unpredictable. For-profit corporations have a rotten track record with this sort of thing, my tribes are picky and hard to please, and mass-scale community-building is gratuitously hard.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not pretend that LiveJournal was a lost golden age, either. LJ had plenty of problems, and the other major candidate for the Good Old Days, Usenet, was an enormous headache in terms of spam, moderation, technical underpinnings, and usability.</p>

<p>What grabbed me about Natasha&rsquo;s post, though, was this:</p>

<blockquote><p>you can always find me on my website, it will never, ever go away. I know having
a strong presence on the open web isn&rsquo;t what everyone does anymore (something that
always disappoints me, and not just because I build websites for a living), but I will
never stop having a strong web presence. And no matter what other services I use, my
website will always be my home base, the place where I post all my content first, and
where I tell you where else to find me.</p></blockquote>

<p>I want to amplify that. Here&rsquo;s the biggest reason you should be wary of Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and everything else in that space: they <em>cannot</em> succeed at what they set out to do, because social life is not just one thing. Natasha asked <em>&ldquo;where does a person go to be truly social on the Internet?&rdquo;</em> and there is no single answer to that. Every answer has a limited reach and an expiration date. To echo Marco Arment, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity">if you want a durable online identity, you have to own it</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>You might think your @gmail.com address will be fine indefinitely, but if I
used a webmail address from the best webmail provider at the time I broke away
from my university address and formed my own identity, it would have ended
in @hotmail.com. And that wasn’t very long ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even if entities like Facebook, Twitter, and Google were inclined to fight the corporate Will to Profit, the task of providing a forum for the best of social activity, for entertaining and edifying public interaction, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on them. Culture, by nature, is always changing, and people&rsquo;s desires change with time. You would do well to think of your avatar on Twitter as standing on a slowly-melting ice floe: it is not a safe long-term place, no matter how solid it seems right now.</p>

<p>The response that Natasha, Marco, and I are all demonstrating in various ways, is &ldquo;you have to have some presence that is <em>yours,</em> that you own.&rdquo; This is not <em>easy</em> easy, but it&rsquo;s <em>easier</em> than it used to be. This is not to say that owning your own domain and putting something there is something other than an ice floe &mdash; what it is, is an ice floe that is larger, melts slower, and gives you ways to hop to another when this one goes under, instead of watching everything that you built vanish.</p>

<p>Taking responsibility for your identity is difficult and complicated, because <em>identity</em> is difficult and complicated. You can get some great benefits by entrusting part of the work of identity to Twitter, Facebook, and the rest &mdash; but you can&rsquo;t trust them entirely, and you can&rsquo;t trust them with the whole work. The ice floe is always melting. You need to know that, even if it looks big and durable right now. One day it will be gone.</p>
