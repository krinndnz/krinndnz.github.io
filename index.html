  <div class="entry-content"><p>I say this a lot in casual conversation, so I may as well write it down.
Here are some promises I&rsquo;m making when I&rsquo;m talking to people.
These hold for everyone I talk to; I also think they&rsquo;re good rules in general.</p>

<ol>
<li>I promise that you are the first and only judge of whether or not you care about something, whether or not it&rsquo;s important to you.</li>
<li>I promise that you are not boring when you talk about the stuff you care about.</li>
<li>I promise that it&rsquo;s okay to talk about what&rsquo;s important to you without apology or shame.</li>
<li>I promise that stuff that&rsquo;s important to you, is important enough to talk about: your life <em>should</em> matter to you!
That the rest of the world exists, doesn&rsquo;t obviate that the events of your life are important to you.</li>
<li>I promise it is okay to talk about the things you want and need to talk about.</li>
<li>I promise that it is okay to <em>not</em> talk about the things you don&rsquo;t want to talk about.</li>
<li>I promise it is okay to talk about things that you&rsquo;re unsure about.
Thinking about something by talking about it is a valuable tool.
Some thoughts are much easier to think with that tool than with wordless solo introspection.</li>
<li>I promise you are qualified to talk about your own experience and your own opinion.</li>
</ol>


<p>Basically, I like to think that when I talk to people I&rsquo;m fond of (I try to also do this with people I dislike, but I do not always succeed), I default to taking you seriously, listening as a peer, and assuming that you <em>matter.</em>
You deserve safety, health, and happiness.
We all deserve that.</p>

<p>My ideas here are heavily informed by Alice Miller&rsquo;s notion of a &ldquo;helping witness,&rdquo; but going into detail about that is another post (and a rather grim one, at that).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went back in time a little today and noted Mark &ldquo;410 Gone&rdquo; Pilgrim&rsquo;s 2008 post,
&ldquo;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100608015359/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/01/17/of-canaries-and-coal-mines">Of Canaries And Coal Mines</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>So after 18 months, I think we can safely say that no, Cory [Doctorow] and I were not &ldquo;canaries
in the coal mine.&rdquo; There are not hordes of fed-up consumers rejecting Apple&rsquo;s vision of
cryptographic lock-in. There are not mass graves where people ceremoniously dump their crippled,
non-general-purpose computing devices. Outside of Planet Debian and my own personal echo chamber,
nobody gives a shit about Freedom 0.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since then, things have only gone further in the direction that Pilgrim and Doctorow despaired
about. Apple has sold a preposterously large number of iPhones and iPads, large enough that it&rsquo;s
actually a bit difficult to get a grasp on how much the game has changed. I&rsquo;m just gonna quote
Marco Arment, since <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/08/19/a-smartphone-retrospective">he absolutely called it</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Smartphones were an established consumer-electronics market with devices that people thought were
pretty cool, but often frustrating and with serious shortcomings and design flaws. &hellip; Other
manufacturers had neglected touchscreens for years, but Apple figured out how to do a touchscreen
well, and did.  Fans of the former types of smartphones and much of the tech press declared this
smartphone useless or not capable enough because of its lack of a keyboard, its non-removable
battery, its lack of expansion slots or ports, and other hardware features in which Apple chose
differently from what most other manufacturers were doing.  That ended up not mattering. Now,
most high-end smartphones look like [the iPhone]. &hellip; [Criticism of the iPad] ended up not
mattering. And now, other manufacturers are scrambling to build tablet products as quickly as
possible.  How do you think the subcompact, inexpensive computer category will look in three
years?</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m willing to take some cheap shots at this: it&rsquo;s what I do, I snicker a little cruelly when
I imagine Cory Doctorow <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110716072627/http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=132">in the role of Iron Eyes Cody</a>, a single tear rolling down
his cheek as he realizes that there are untold billions of people who don&rsquo;t care about &ldquo;Freedom
Zero.&rdquo; His tear is the tear of the modernist project, the realization that whoops, Western European
affluent-white-dude values are not in fact universal, and there may have to be some difficult
negotiation in the future to figure out (a) what values people advocate (b) what values they
actually live by and &copy; whether people can get along within the self-imposed constraints of (a)
and (b).</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t get genuinely angry at Doctorow, though. I&rsquo;m pretty bummed out when I think that billions
of people don&rsquo;t share <em>my</em> values, because I&rsquo;m as egotistical as anyone else and still have a nice
little candle in my heart of &ldquo;If <em>I</em> was running the show you&rsquo;d see some changes around here pretty
darn quick!&rdquo; At worst I think he&rsquo;s kinda naïve. It&rsquo;s borderline tautological to say that people
outside the engineer/hacker culture and professions do not share its ideological concerns. If you
walked up to an attorney cold and asked her what &ldquo;Freedom Zero&rdquo; was, you would probably get an
answer that has nothing to do with &ldquo;screws, not glue.&rdquo; The phrase might register as a complete
non-sequitur to a scuba dive instructor, a barista, a social worker, an undergraduate working the
register at a gas station, a costumed worker at Disneyland.</p>

<p>I acknowledge the counterargument of &ldquo;if people were more informed about the issue, they&rsquo;d care,&rdquo;
but you have to note that that&rsquo;s an argument you can make about <em>anything</em> and it&rsquo;s perilously
close to the fallacy of &ldquo;if people were better informed they&rsquo;d agree with me!&rdquo; So I think that it&rsquo;s
to be avoided. What I think is that people care about themselves first&mdash;thinking as our
rational-logical selves, paying rigorous attention to our professed ideals and to how our actions
fit them or fail to, is difficult and we&rsquo;re usually half-assing it. Yes, all of us, because we&rsquo;re
all fallible people prone to thinking more about what we want than whether getting it is worthwhile
or having it will actually make us as happy as we think.</p>

<p>One of my favorite jabs at this human tendency comes from the San Francisco stand-up comic Will
Durst, who <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/id260036485?partnerId=30&amp;siteID=k*tkOlz87uA">had a great riff on it in the early Bush years</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, man. That 300 bucks last August&mdash;that rebate check came in handy. I live
here in town, I paid off two parking tickets with it. But we had this windfall, we could have
done <em>anything</em> with it. We could have paid for every hot lunch program in America through the
year 2054. We could have put in a down payment on prescription drugs, which they talked about
last November and now we haven&rsquo;t heard Word One of. We could have done a lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, you can&rsquo;t do that. Uh-uh. No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, the American People <em>want</em> tax cuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well <strong>duh!</strong> The American People also want drive-through nickel beer night! The American People
want to lose weight by eating ice cream. The American People would chew off their own <em>foot</em> if
Oprah told them there was liquid gold in their ankle veins! The American People love the Home
Shopping Network because it&rsquo;s commercial-free.</p></blockquote>

<p>Humanity has a long and illustrious track record of wanting things that aren&rsquo;t particularly good
for us. I&rsquo;m not saying that Freedom Zero is one of those things. I&rsquo;m actually with Doctorow in that
I think that more people tinkering, exploring, and creating, is inherently a Good Thing. I just
think that Freedom Zero is a bit too narrowly defined, and thus Doctorow tends to undervalue good
things produced by people who don&rsquo;t care as much about freedom-to-tinker as he does. At this point
I think it&rsquo;s very safe to say that the &ldquo;iPads are for consumption&rdquo; canard is dead, but it&rsquo;s not
just that. The deal with iPhones and the Apple ecosystem in general, is that they&rsquo;re a
trade-off. It&rsquo;s fine for Doctorow to reject that trade-off for himself, but I think that he&rsquo;s in
error with his rationale for encouraging others to reject it; I think he&rsquo;s projecting his values
onto them. That&rsquo;s an error. If you go and look at what people are doing with their devices, you&rsquo;ll
find that they&rsquo;re doing things that are valuable to <em>them,</em> which is unrelated to what&rsquo;s valuable
to Cory Doctorow.</p>

<p>If you want to persuade others, to talk them into changing their behavior, you need to figure out
what&rsquo;s important to them and avoid assuming that what matters to you matters to them. That&rsquo;s part
of what makes persuasion hard&mdash;that and the massive disconnect between what we profess to want and
what we are actually happier to have. That&rsquo;s my vote for what people <em>should</em> care about: being
clear on our own desires.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to have this here because apparently the lyrics-crap sites (and boy <em>there&rsquo;s</em> a genre of
website that makes you glad you got ad blocking and NoScript) haven&rsquo;t picked up on Deltron Event II
yet. As long as I&rsquo;m listening to this song a bunch I may as well transcribe it and have a reference
for the lyrics.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Old-Timer 1:</em> Oh the city! Chillin' on the stoop in the future.</p>

<p><em>Old-Timer 2:</em> You said it, space friend!</p>

<p><em>Old-Timer 1</em>: Boy, I tell you things these days move too fast! Makes me wanna crack wise about how
it was back in the day. Yo, homeless robot! Drop a stupid-ass beatbox.</p>

<p><em>Homeless Robot:</em> Shit is not going well for homeless robot 235</p>

<p>{old-timer 1 raps}</p>

<p>Before a best seller meant your record went interstellar <br>
Before the impeccable smeller <br>
Before they banned Old Yeller <br>
In the wake of the Presidential dogfucking scandal <br></p>

<p>When astronauts rocked sports sandals and didn&rsquo;t have expandable mandibles <br>
And granules of Jack Daniels didn&rsquo;t heal the wounds of animals <br>
When botanicals still weren&rsquo;t a biological weapon <br>
In the war with the tarantulas <br></p>

<p>Back in the day before time travel was easy-peasy <br>
But now I go back, re-rap to make it sound repeaty <br>
Back in the day before time travel was easy-peasy <br>
Back in the day before time travel was easy-peasy <br>
Now we change history like the feat is measly <br></p>

<p>Stars these days don&rsquo;t know how good they have it <br>
We used to have plutonium in our jet pack and <br>
We had to take the supertube before it had hyperdrive <br>
Makes me wanna holler! Unh! But we&rsquo;re still alive! <br></p>

<p>{miscellaneous robot-abusing chatter}</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting bit of world-building, especially since it encourages us to mistrust the
narrators a bit - &ldquo;back in <em>my</em> day&rdquo; is already a tall-tale genre, and what might people who think
it&rsquo;s acceptable to abuse synthpersons be ignoring about the past?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While there are many things I like about Tumblr, I have a bottomless appetite for cheap shots at it
(e.g. <a href="http://mightygodking.com/2013/06/04/this-act-of-creative-and-historical-vandalism-is-not-technically-my-fault/">Folsom Prison Feels</a>) and a few serious beefs. The one that I&rsquo;m here to talk about
today is not about Tumblr as a company or platform but Tumblr as a culture, and particularly about
the crop of young social-justice advocates coming up through it. Of course I make allowance here
for the way that any generation of activists will spend a fair bit of time carping about the next:
good lord, just thinking of what particularly vocal second-wave feminists have to say about my
cohort makes the roots of my hair tingle.</p>

<p>I want to talk about this problem, though, partially because it&rsquo;s a failure of thought-rigor that
we&rsquo;re all prone to. I just see it more often in the Tumblr crowd&mdash;I have ideas about why that is,
but certainly they&rsquo;re not the only people capable of this fallacy. The fallacy goes like this:
given that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">The Patriarchy and other toxic power systems</a> exist, as unavoidably
widespread and oppressive forces, and given that they are a member of a class that those systems do
harm to, too many people behave as though the partiarchy (or power system <em>du jour</em>) is a
conspiracy that is out to get them particularly.</p>

<p>This is fallacious in both its halves: part of why the toxic power systems are so hard to deal with
is that they are <em>not</em> conspiracies, and that they are <em>not</em> after you in particular: it is
enough that you are there and you are a member of some disfavored class. Ignoring your
individuality is a feature of the system.</p>

<p>I am of course indebted to <a href="http://zingerella.livejournal.com/73987.html?format=light">an older exploration of the matter</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, there is no one Patriarch, leastaways not outside of Constantinople. There&rsquo;s no single dude
in a nifty hat at the top of the power structure, surrounded by scantily clad women whom he
feeds to tigers for his kicks and giggles. If it were only that simple, we could off the old
wanker, free the women and give them some trousers, find loving homes for the tigers, and have a
great party around the bonfire of his palace (after salvaging all the good art, books, and
chocolate). Alas, because the patriarchy is instead a very very old system that has warped
everyone&rsquo;s thinking right down to the sub-rational, axiomatic, non-verbal ideological level, it&rsquo;s
much more difficult to overthrow. (We&rsquo;ve seen how well wars against ideas work.)</p>

<p>[&hellip;] The Gentleman complained that calling the androcentric system of how things are, or male
privilege &ldquo;the patriarchy&rdquo; personifies it, and makes it seem like a conspiracy theory in which
all men are agents of this big conspiracy to keep women down. He said that saying that &ldquo;the
system serves to perpetuate itself,&rdquo; further personifies something that is, after all, merely a
structure put in place by people, and something that not all men support.</p>

<p>The patriarchy is not a system in the way that the Library of Congress system of cataloguing is a
system. It&rsquo;s not spelled out anywhere, no single person or group of people sat down and dreamed
it up, and people don&rsquo;t usually debate its merits over those of any other system that does the
same thing. I don&rsquo;t think even Men&rsquo;s Rights Activists get up in the morning and think &ldquo;Dude! I&rsquo;m
so glad I live in a patriarchy! I&rsquo;m gonna go subjugate me some women today!&rdquo; Instead we <strong>all</strong>
live in a system that exists on patriarchal premises.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about conspiracies. Conspiracy theories are a mode of thought that we&rsquo;re all prone to,
in varying degrees. This is because as humans, we are pattern-finders. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">Apophenia</a>
is our life. Further, we&rsquo;re all self-centered&mdash;necessarily, for <em>your</em> life should be about
<em>you</em>, it can&rsquo;t healthily be about someone else. This has the side effect, though, that we&rsquo;re
prone to believing that events in the world around us are also about us. Very little that is
happening around you in your life is about you, though.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories, then, are a natural outgrowth of this: they propose that something important
is being hidden by malicious actors working in concert. The combination of pattern-finding,
self-centeredness, and the simple fact that not all events in the world are comprehensible and few
are controllable, can lead any of us to explanations for those events that range into the
conspiratorial. A recent incident illustrated the tendency in what I find a grimly humorous way:
the 2010 paper <em>&ldquo;NASA faked the moon landing–therefore (climate) science is a hoax: an anatomy of
the motivated rejection of science&rdquo;</em> tentatively identified that people who think climate science
is a giant hoax or a conspiracy, also tend to have other conspiratorial-type
beliefs. Unsurprisingly, the rejecters of climate-change science had many criticisms of the
paper&mdash;which led to the same authors' 2013 paper <em>&ldquo;Recursive fury: conspiracist ideation in the
blogosphere in response to research on conspiracist ideation,&rdquo;</em> whose subtitle basically sums it up
(cheap shot interlude: &ldquo;Recursive Fury&rdquo; is my punk-covers-of-Douglas-Hofstatder band).</p>

<p>A <a href="http://academia.edu/1207098/Dead_and_alive_Beliefs_in_contradictory_conspiracy_theories">2012 paper from the University of Kent</a> uses a different way of illustrating the
point:</p>

<blockquote><p>Conspiracy theories can form a monological belief system: A self-sustaining worldview comprised
of a network of mutually supportive beliefs. The present research shows that even mutually
incompatible conspiracy theories are positively correlated in endorsement. In Study 1, the more
participants believed that Princess Diana faked her own death, the more they believed that she
was murdered. In Study 2, the more participants believed that Osama Bin Laden was already dead
when U.S. special forces raided his compound in Pakistan, the more they believed he is still
alive. Hierarchical regression models showed that mutually incompatible conspiracy theories are
positively associated because both are associated with the view that the authorities are engaged
in a cover-up. The monological nature of conspiracy belief appears to be driven not by conspiracy
theories directly supporting one another but by broader beliefs supporting conspiracy theories in
general.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Recursive Fury</em>, meanwhile, uses a six-point set of criteria for conspiratorial thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Nefarious Intent:</strong> Assuming that the presumed conspirators have nefarious intentions. For
example, if person X assumes that blogger Y colluded with the New York Times to publish a paper
damaging to X, then X presumes nefarious intent on the part of Y.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persecuted Victim:</strong> Self-identifying as the victim of an organised persecution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nihilistic Skepticism:</strong> Refusing to believe anything that doesn&rsquo;t fit into the conspiracy
theory. Note that &ldquo;conspiracy theory&rdquo; here is a fairly broad term and need not involve a global
conspiracy (e.g., that NASA faked the moon landing) but can refer to small-scale events and
hypotheses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nothing Occurs By Accident:</strong> Weaving any small random event into the conspiracy narrative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Something Must Be Wrong:</strong> Switching liberally between different, even contradictory
conspiracy theories that have in common only the presumption that there is something wrong in
the official account by the alleged conspirators. Thus, people may simultaneously believe that
Princess Diana faked her own death and that she was assassinated by MI5.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Sealing Reasoning:</strong> Interpreting any evidence against the conspiracy as evidence for the
conspiracy. For example, when climate scientists are exonerated of any wrong-doing 9 times over
by different investigations, this is reinterpreted to imply that the climate-change conspiracy
involves not just the world’s climate scientists but also the investigating bodies and
associated governments.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I think it&rsquo;s crucially important here to avoid saying &ldquo;oh man those conspiracy buffs, they&rsquo;ll
believe anything.&rdquo; Conspiracy theories are a pattern of thought that we are <em>all</em> vulnerable to. In
varying degrees, true, but all of us are vulnerable, and a feeling of certainty is no defense. This
is part of why we feminists, we activists, we strivers for a better world, need to especially
beware of conspiracy-theory thinking. <strong>The patriarchy is not a conspiracy.</strong></p>

<p>We encounter the patriarchy and related toxic power systems most often in a context where they are
likely to do us personal harm: of course we take it personally! But you will go grievously wrong
assuming that the system (as opposed to individual actors) dislikes you personally. You are a
wonderful person but conspiracies, as Mr. Assange tirelessly reminds us, are needy beasts and you
are not worth the effort of keeping a conspiracy running. Instead, the patriarchy is a system of
interlocking systems, which long ago passed the point where the beneficiaries and those hoping for
their table-scraps needed only act in furtherance of their self-interest, without conspiring with
anyone else, for the system to be perpetuated. When we are harmed, when we are in pain, it is
difficult to believe that it is not about us, but it really isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Another face of this system is the United States' mainstream media&mdash;or to call it more accurately,
the propaganda system by which Official Facts are distributed (I am drawing heavily from Chomsky
here). This system is harmful to many of us, and has the effect of maintaining elite power at the
expense of the common good. It too is not a conspiracy and it does not care about you, the
news-consumer, personally. It is just the same: the system is rigged such that actors pursue their
own self-interest independently and perpetuate the system in that way. That is precisely why the
propaganda system, and the patriarchal power structures in general, are so difficult to push back
against: they are in a sense decentralized.</p>

<p>No matter how much power he may personally wield, it is vanishingly rare that a beneficiary thinks
of himself as blessed with the power of a system backing him. Indeed he generally has had to expend
considerable effort disposing of rivals for that benefit, and takes this effort for evidence of
merit. He who reaches the VP suite or the Senate or the upper echelons of an important bureaucracy,
has had to do a great deal of work and apply a great deal of ingenuity. What he generally resists
seeing, is that someone who did as much work and applied as much ingenuity, but who did not have
the benefit of a system of power behind them, would not be rewarded in the same way (they may in
fact be punished: there&rsquo;s a strong argument that lynchings were
<a href="http://bradhicks.livejournal.com/378012.html?format=light">more an economic crime than a hate crime</a>).</p>

<p>Of course there are still further complications. The baneful power systems that we&rsquo;re trying to
disrupt operate as interlocking systems and at the most abstract level, they are systems of
interactions between classes of person (not just class in the economic sense, but in just about any
way you can divide people into Us and Them). But the operation of these large systems is to spawn
smaller systems, which may repeat the process, until actual work and reification-of-hierarchy gets
done at the margins. I am not a class of person unto myself, nor is a police officer, but together
we operate the system whereby the state asserts a monopoly on
<a href="http://crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/violence.php">the use and definition of violence</a>.</p>

<p>The reason that it&rsquo;s important to note this fractal nature of systems is that if you follow it down
far enough, you will find conspiracies. Small, petty, cruel conspiracies that ruin lives, bodies,
and minds, they are nasty operations&mdash;but they are not the system that they are embedded in,
rather they are a product of it. However, they are rarer than you might think, because the secrecy
criteria is important. Remember that we&rsquo;re not counting the Family Research Council as a
conspiracy: they are actors colluding to do harm to queers, women, and pretty much everyone, but
they&rsquo;re not doing so in secret: they are quite clear about their goals, membership, tactics,
etc. They issue press releases. There are plenty of subsystems like them, including some that do
target individuals, but we need to resist letting those lure us into conspiratorial thinking.</p>

<p>The six-point scale from <em>Recursive Fury</em> can be useful for pushing against this tendency: it&rsquo;s not
a panacea, but it is a useful reminder that we&rsquo;re talking about big sloppy human systems, not
against powerful, malicious schemers. Thinking in terms of systems is an important part of the
activist toolkit, because individual actions don&rsquo;t happen in a vacuum. They have antecedents and
causes. Even on the interpersonal level, a person is not any of their actions: they are at the very
least actions and discourses over time, which is very different. For groups, likewise. Conspiracies
are rare enough that you should assume that events in the world around you are <em>not</em> the result of
a conspiracy, even if they cause you pain and are difficult to understand. Perhaps especially then.</p>

<p>Now, I know a bunch of people who spend a lot of time in <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html">the security mindset</a> who&rsquo;re
going to want some caveats to be attached to this. So: there certainly are situations where you&rsquo;ll
want to worry about conspiracies, and some of those conspiracies will have an agenda that amounts
to &ldquo;kill you if you get too inconvenient to entrenched power systems.&rdquo; The best example is how
police departments and the FBI routinely employ <em>agents provocateur</em> against anyone with a remotely
anti-hierarchical agenda (to the point of being assholes to Food Not Bombs, wielders of one of the
most innocuous activism tactics imaginable). However, these situations are both rare and
illustrative that conspiracies are expensive and difficult. The big-picture system being resisted
and disrupted, is not a conspiracy.</p>

<p>I started out by talking about Tumblr, but this is a problem that&rsquo;s specific to human cognition,
not specific to Tumblr. Tumblr just happens to be full of young folks, who are normal young folks
and thus charmingly overconfident and full of anger, not yet scarred in the specific way that
produces a certain <a href="http://woborders.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/debating-tactics-remember-to-ask-what-works/">pragmatism</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">parsimony of causes</a>, and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">cynical optimism about others' actions</a>. Age is no guarantee that a person will come
around to a productive approach&mdash;which is to say, eschewing dramatic first resorts, patient in
proportion to how they hope for their own (inevitable) follies to be treated with patience, and
always curious as to whether there is some item of mutual agreement that could be worked towards
rather than having yet another argument.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the real sin of conspiratorial thinking, if you ask me: by presenting tempting-but-wrong
explanations for the world, it will very effectively keep you from <em>getting things done.</em> As you
make your way through the world you cannot avoid encountering the painful, the inexplicable, and
the unjust. Working against them is difficult&mdash;and conspiratorial thinking will sabotage your
work. Perhaps we could consider inverting the checklist from <em>Recursive Fury</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Selfish Intent:</strong> Assume that other people primarily care about themselves. They&rsquo;re not
stupid, they have a whole life to live, but that life is about them and not about you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bemused Observer:</strong> Be deeply conservative in assumptions about whether or not people are out
to get you, especially in an organized manner. People generally organize for themselves, not for
you (see 1).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Judicious Acceptance:</strong> Systems made up of humans are messy, not neat, and almost never
elegant. Dramatized stories about them almost always leave out the screw-ups, friction, and
dawdling. If a conspiracy looks excellently efficient, slick, and deft, it might not exist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acknowledgement Of Accidents:</strong> Plenty of things happen by accident or without
planning. Account for impulse and coincidence when you account for people&rsquo;s actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If There&rsquo;s No Plan, It Can&rsquo;t Be Going Wrong:</strong> Acknowledging that much of the world is not
just beyond your control, but beyond anyone&rsquo;s control, undermines the idea that a conspiracy is
bending events towards their ends. Of course the world is not quite as you would like it&mdash;but
you are just like everyone else in percieving that the world is imperfect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open-Ended Reasoning:</strong> Avoid at all costs becoming locked into non-falsifiable patterns of
thought: if you have a belief that can neither be proven nor disproven, you have a belief that
needs to be harshly examined. This is especially true of deciding that people you interact with
are malicious or untrustworthy: once you commit to that belief, you commit to a pattern of
actions that will make it extraordinarily hard for them to behave benevolently towards you or
extend trust to you, and your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> will carry the day.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Of course this is just a sketch towards the general plan of resisting conspiratorial thinking, but
it&rsquo;s a starting-place and that&rsquo;s important to have. The point of a starting-place is that you don&rsquo;t
remain there, that you make a concerted effort of getting to somewhere else. The metaphor of travel
also gives us this: look at the whole journey from time to time, not just the next step. Cultivate
a flexibility of perspective. After all, one way of looking at patriarchy is to call it the
conspiracy theory that women are all out to get you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> is one of the great achievements of videogames. I tend towards comparing
it to <em>Super Metroid,</em> although one could go other directions. Both games cultivate an atmosphere
of solitude and the uncanny, focusing on a solo protagonist in an alien place. They&rsquo;re not only
masterfully executed, great fun as games, but also are achievers of a high ambition in games: they
expand the player&rsquo;s sense of the possible. The team who built <em>Ico</em> expanded and refined their
ideas, and as a result, <em>Shadow</em> was a truly great game, expanding a mass audience&rsquo;s sense of what
the medium of videogames was capable of.</p>

<p>All of this is on my mind because I recently encountered a Eurogamer article,
<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-02-the-quest-for-shadow-of-the-colossuss-last-big-secret">&ldquo;The Quest for Shadow of the Colossus' Last Big Secret,&rdquo;</a> pointing out that a game
pushing ten years old is still drawing a small crowd of searchers determined to find everything
that can be found in the game. I&rsquo;m pleasantly reminded of how the executive-meddling-crippled
<em>KOTOR II</em> was the beneficiary of a fan effort to restore cut content and fix outstanding bugs. The
story of the searchers here is a compelling one, and I recommend it to you along with other
<a href="http://www.glitterberri.com/shadow-of-the-colossus/">fan-made</a> <a href="http://lparchive.org/Shadow-of-the-Colossus/">amplifications</a> of the game.</p>

<p>I love how, at best, the form is a way to make critical thinking cheaper. Of course it may also
fail to do that&mdash;but on a good day, it&rsquo;s a way to repudiate bad ideas by contextualizing them, by
adding relevant information instead of by shouting. Snowcloning it into different contexts is also
at a sweet-spot difficulty level: easy enough to be tempting, but hard enough to be a bit of
serious work worth respecting. It&rsquo;s a great way to summarize &ldquo;here is the bar to entry for new
techniques, this problem is in fact hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another amusing thing is how often the &ldquo;Asshats&rdquo; and &ldquo;No-one will be able to find the guy or
collect the money&rdquo; objections appear verbatim. Some things cross many, many fields of human
endeavour.</p>

<p>For bonus points, here&rsquo;s someone making an interesting argument that the original form was wrong,

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I am the kind of person who read <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> once in high school and came away with an
uneasy feeling rather than a burning conviction: it felt somehow petty to me. This is probably
because I was reading Asimov&rsquo;s <em>Foundation</em> novels at the same time, and the contrast between Hari
Seldon and John Galt was dramatic and deeply unflattering to Galt. Faced with a cruel and
overbearing government, a lone genius opts to found a colony of the like-minded in a secluded
place. However, their tactics are strikingly different: Galt opts to affirmatively destroy the
system, heedless of consequences, while Hari Seldon is all about mindfulness of the consequences. I
think that&rsquo;s one of the things that really gets to me about the center of the Randian movement:
despite pretensions of intellectualism, they are blinded both to where they came from and where
they are going. That is not a good recipe for a movement.</p>

<p>Those are broad strokes, though: there is a specific thing I&rsquo;d forgotten, that Adam Lee ably points
out:</p>

<blockquote><p>Of all the businesses Rand could have chosen for her heroes, I always thought that railroads were
a bad choice to show the superiority of laissez-faire capitalism. After all, railroads, like
other forms of infrastructure, almost always take major government support and investment to
build. [&hellip;] In reality, the first American transcontinental railroad required major government
financial support&mdash;to the tune of $16,000 per mile, rising to $48,000 per mile over the Rocky
Mountains&mdash;plus extensive land grants. Modern engineering projects of similar scope, like the
Keystone XL pipeline, have been embroiled in court fights with dozens of private landowners who
don’t want to sell, and Keystone’s builders have been extremely aggressive about invoking eminent
domain.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story proceeds from merely unrealistic, as Lee notes here, to gleefully barbaric. It is part of
a pattern where every time I think &ldquo;well, I should maybe give <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> another chance, as
literature if not as dogma,&rdquo; some excerpt or another comes along and convinces me that Rand was
definitely the predecessor to L. Ron Hubbard: promulgating a con-job religion on the backs of some
awful sci-fi novels. Ugh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My pal Paka has a great point about <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Okay, so <strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong> ends with the heroes failing miserably. They <strong>win,</strong> but
they do so failing. Han basically dies, keeping Chewie from losing his temper and getting Leia
killed in the process. Luke basically suicides but he doesn&rsquo;t join the Dark Side. And Lando, I&rsquo;ve
realized, gives up everything rather than being a nice little stoolie.</p>

<p>Think about this for a bit. Han has nothing to lose other than his life, two friends, and a ship
which has already been impounded. Luke would lose his ethics at the price of very probably
helping Vader kill Palpatine and at some point killing Vader and becoming Emperor himself. It
makes me grind teeth to realize that Leia is sort of The Obligatory Woman and doesn&rsquo;t really get
a character moment like that. Lando loses the most. He&rsquo;s been hoping this whole time that if he
plays nice with the legal authorities (and note here, he&rsquo;s one of three Black guys you ever see
in that universe, so he&rsquo;s the minority made good in a system run by crusty white rich people),
they&rsquo;ll let him have his business and his friends can make bail, and then the deal gets worse and
worse and worse. Lando could potentially accept worse and worse and worse and he&rsquo;d still come out
of it with a retirement plan, health care, stock options, and enough income to keep himself in
Colt 40 and awesome capes for the rest of his life. Things which he probably didn&rsquo;t have quite
that much of before when he was Lando scraping by on gambling. And boom, it&rsquo;s all gone because
being Lando freaking Calrissian is at the end way more important to him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lando Calrissian has always complicated the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. I like
Paka&rsquo;s reading here quite a bit.</p>
