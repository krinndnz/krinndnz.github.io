  <div class="entry-content"><p>My dream was an arthouse film. The director wanted to both interrogate her experience of second-wave feminism and to partially rebuke it. It was a murder anti-mystery. The murder happens ten minutes in and it is never in doubt to characters or audience who did it. The murder victim is the only male character in the story, and I&rsquo;m not sure whether he had a name. Everyone on-screen was a woman. The murderer was tracked down, apprehended, tried, and convicted, but most of the people involved were aware that her resistance to any of these steps was perfunctory. The whole edifice of justice operates without men involved - it was distinctly not vigilante justice, it was just an operation of the courts that happened not to involve men at all. The women involved spanned a wide age range - there were definitely some precocious ten-year-olds and tweens in there as well as some high-school students. The point was to show participants and audience a world in which women operate all of these things is not only not particularly difficult to imagine, but it&rsquo;s also possible to enact if you&rsquo;re clever about it. The world is not better or worse run by just women - but isn&rsquo;t it peculiar that the world we live in is run mostly like this but with men at the helm?</p>

<p>I have some problems with the system independent of who&rsquo;s operating it and I&rsquo;m not sure that the director agreed with me about that. But it was a good movie, and it appealed to me that the protagonist and her unseen collaborators among the police and prosecution only with difficulty came to the conclusion that demonstrating their principles was worth two lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>These are the people who invented &ldquo;la vie de Boheme.&rdquo;
They invented the lifestyle of the urban middle-class
dropout art-gypsy.  They invented its terminology and its
tactics.  They brought us the &ldquo;succes de scandale,&rdquo; the
now time-honored tactic of shocking one&rsquo;s audience all the
way to the bank.  And the &ldquo;succes d'estime,&rdquo; the edgy and
hazardous life of the critics' darling.  The doctrine of
art for art&rsquo;s sake was theirs too (thank you, Theophile
Gautier).  And the ever-helpful notion of <em>epater les
bourgeoisie,</em> an act of consummately modern rebellion
which is nevertheless impossible without a <em>bourgeoisie</em> to
<em>epater,</em> an act which the bourgeoisie itself has lavishly
financed for decades in our culture&rsquo;s premiere example of
Aldissian enantiodromia &ndash; the transformation of things
into their opposites. The Paris Bohemians were the first genuine
industrial-scale counterculture.  This was the culture
that created Jules Verne.  It deserves a great deal of the
credit or blame for origination of the genres of horror,
fantasy, and science fiction.  It has a legitimate claim
on our attention and our loyalties.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the experiences that <a href="http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Postfurry">PR and PV</a> have had that I&rsquo;m a bit jealous of, is that of encountering Bruce Sterling for the first time in the mid-90s. It&rsquo;s debatable whether that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d call &ldquo;the height of his powers,&rdquo; but the man has a powerful and bone-deep vision of possible futures that he is compelled to share (he also nicely illustrates that a solid knowledge of history is indispensable if you want to write science fiction). Encountering him in the 90s and seeing what he has to say about the Internet and counterculture, I can see why one might feel compelled to tell others, to share the vision. PR and PV have said in about so many words, that part of why postfurry is a thing, is Bruce Sterling. The vision persists.</p>

<p>It opens questions that make me shiver. I talked to someone recently and found out that I am not sure that postfurry has enough heft to sustain being written about, analyzed, explained. On the other hand, I have a deep and persistent feeling that there is something interesting and worthwhile there.</p>

<p>One of the habits of the furry subculture that troubles me is the fear of excluding people. It makes me squint suspiciously. You <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2010/01/this-presupposition-of-passivity.html">can&rsquo;t have a community unless you have a rule</a> for who&rsquo;s in and who&rsquo;s out. It needn&rsquo;t be phrased too harshly - but such a rule must exist. In a geographic community, the rule is easy: if you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re in, if you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re out. But furry in general, because of its attachment to the Internet, and postfurry in particular, aims to be post-geographic. Thus, <em>some</em> rule is necessary - and if one is not consciously developed, one will de facto emerge from the community&rsquo;s id. I am not a fan of that prospect.</p>

<p>There are things to love about the furry subculture, and I love the postfurry community &mdash; but the future shape of a community is determined by the work invested in the present, and I&rsquo;m worried about that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a lot of reasons that you should care about Unicode. As someone who uses the web, you should know what it is and that representing human language is hard, and thus once in a while &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; and variations will show up. If you&rsquo;re someone who creates code or prose content for the web, you want to know a little more - I recommend <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s Unicode primer</a>.</p>

<p>And if you&rsquo;re a big ol' furry, you should know that there are a bunch of animal-face glyphs, like the one I&rsquo;m using to indicate link-blog posts here. &#x1f63c;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Is there a style of garment more iconically late 20th/early 21st century than the hoodie? Worn by CEOs and street kids. Worn by teens who wanna look like cats and rappers who wanna look hard. Worn by punks and skaters and breakdancers and taggers and Occupy protesters and college kids and sports fans. Worn by Rocky Balboa and the Wu-Tang and Ted Kazynski and Paris Hilton and Trayvon Martin and Mark Zuckerberg.

<p>Quiet Babylon has a great essay about the hoodie.</p>

<p>Seth Godin is an ongoing source of inspiration to me. I have a nasty love-hate relationship with
advertising, but Godin does a great job of making me feel inspired about the great work of
persuasion. He&rsquo;s like the Scott McCloud of it: in the same way as re-reading McCloud&rsquo;s comics
trilogy makes me wave my hands and shout &ldquo;hooray comics!&rdquo;, Godin&rsquo;s work energizes me. He is also an
interesting kind of optimist: his work generally assumes that <em>you already have good ideas.</em> You
do. The challenge is turning good ideas into great ideas, which takes a lot of work, and persuading
others that your idea is great, which also takes a lot of work. But with Godin as my cheerleader, I
feel equipped to take that work on.</p>
