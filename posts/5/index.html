  <div class="entry-content"><p>Twitter yanked TweetDeck out of Natasha Lockheart&rsquo;s hands, and she&rsquo;s unhappy about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Where does a person go to be truly social on the internet? This is a question I find
myself asking all too often, and once I settle in somewhere, I seem to have to find
somewhere else to go. Today, Twitter announced that they were pulling all non-web-based
versions of Tweetdeck, and in doing so, they will no longer function after May of this year.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t very fond of TweetDeck, myself: I thought that the multi-network functionality was the best thing it had going for it, and since I despise Facebook and think LinkedIn is dubious, that wasn&rsquo;t exactly a win for me. On top of that, it&rsquo;s been obvious for a while that <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/twitter-is-pivoting">Twitter is pivoting</a> &mdash; that they are not interested in being &ldquo;good&rdquo; as Natasha and I define &ldquo;good.&rdquo; First they <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/16/twitter-drop-dead">told developers where to shove it</a>, then they changed the experience for the top tier of users. As Dustin Curtis points out, &ldquo;people on Facebook tend to friend their friends, <a href="http://dcurt.is/twitters-graph">people on Twitter tend to follow their interests</a>,&rdquo; making it a communications stream that&rsquo;s more appealing to advertisers than most Facebook chatter. Twitter is pretty clearly not interested in the opinions of users who want a Twitter that they <em>interact</em> with. If you can think like a pointy-haired boss for a minute, it follows pretty clearly: people who want to interact with the service are pushy, demanding, and far less profitable than people who just <em>consume</em> the service. As a result, Twitter is going to continue turning into television (“<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/08/twitter-bullshit/">this is the moment in Twitter’s life where they kicked Steve Jobs out of the company and told Sculley to run it.</a>”)</p>

<p>I consider it firmly established that Twitter is not interested in being what my tribe wants it to be. Given that, the most likely scenario for the future is that Twitter will suck &mdash; for my tribe, that is; it&rsquo;s entirely possible that at the same time they will make a ton of money and stabilize with hundreds of millions of users. This is sad, but not unpredictable. For-profit corporations have a rotten track record with this sort of thing, my tribes are picky and hard to please, and mass-scale community-building is gratuitously hard.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not pretend that LiveJournal was a lost golden age, either. LJ had plenty of problems, and the other major candidate for the Good Old Days, Usenet, was an enormous headache in terms of spam, moderation, technical underpinnings, and usability.</p>

<p>What grabbed me about Natasha&rsquo;s post, though, was this:</p>

<blockquote><p>you can always find me on my website, it will never, ever go away. I know having
a strong presence on the open web isn&rsquo;t what everyone does anymore (something that
always disappoints me, and not just because I build websites for a living), but I will
never stop having a strong web presence. And no matter what other services I use, my
website will always be my home base, the place where I post all my content first, and
where I tell you where else to find me.</p></blockquote>

<p>I want to amplify that. Here&rsquo;s the biggest reason you should be wary of Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and everything else in that space: they <em>cannot</em> succeed at what they set out to do, because social life is not just one thing. Natasha asked <em>&ldquo;where does a person go to be truly social on the Internet?&rdquo;</em> and there is no single answer to that. Every answer has a limited reach and an expiration date. To echo Marco Arment, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity">if you want a durable online identity, you have to own it</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>You might think your @gmail.com address will be fine indefinitely, but if I
used a webmail address from the best webmail provider at the time I broke away
from my university address and formed my own identity, it would have ended
in @hotmail.com. And that wasn’t very long ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even if entities like Facebook, Twitter, and Google were inclined to fight the corporate Will to Profit, the task of providing a forum for the best of social activity, for entertaining and edifying public interaction, I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on them. Culture, by nature, is always changing, and people&rsquo;s desires change with time. You would do well to think of your avatar on Twitter as standing on a slowly-melting ice floe: it is not a safe long-term place, no matter how solid it seems right now.</p>

<p>The response that Natasha, Marco, and I are all demonstrating in various ways, is &ldquo;you have to have some presence that is <em>yours,</em> that you own.&rdquo; This is not <em>easy</em> easy, but it&rsquo;s <em>easier</em> than it used to be. This is not to say that owning your own domain and putting something there is something other than an ice floe &mdash; what it is, is an ice floe that is larger, melts slower, and gives you ways to hop to another when this one goes under, instead of watching everything that you built vanish.</p>

<p>Taking responsibility for your identity is difficult and complicated, because <em>identity</em> is difficult and complicated. You can get some great benefits by entrusting part of the work of identity to Twitter, Facebook, and the rest &mdash; but you can&rsquo;t trust them entirely, and you can&rsquo;t trust them with the whole work. The ice floe is always melting. You need to know that, even if it looks big and durable right now. One day it will be gone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My dream was an arthouse film. The director wanted to both interrogate her experience of second-wave feminism and to partially rebuke it. It was a murder anti-mystery. The murder happens ten minutes in and it is never in doubt to characters or audience who did it. The murder victim is the only male character in the story, and I&rsquo;m not sure whether he had a name. Everyone on-screen was a woman. The murderer was tracked down, apprehended, tried, and convicted, but most of the people involved were aware that her resistance to any of these steps was perfunctory. The whole edifice of justice operates without men involved - it was distinctly not vigilante justice, it was just an operation of the courts that happened not to involve men at all. The women involved spanned a wide age range - there were definitely some precocious ten-year-olds and tweens in there as well as some high-school students. The point was to show participants and audience a world in which women operate all of these things is not only not particularly difficult to imagine, but it&rsquo;s also possible to enact if you&rsquo;re clever about it. The world is not better or worse run by just women - but isn&rsquo;t it peculiar that the world we live in is run mostly like this but with men at the helm?</p>

<p>I have some problems with the system independent of who&rsquo;s operating it and I&rsquo;m not sure that the director agreed with me about that. But it was a good movie, and it appealed to me that the protagonist and her unseen collaborators among the police and prosecution only with difficulty came to the conclusion that demonstrating their principles was worth two lives.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>These are the people who invented &ldquo;la vie de Boheme.&rdquo;
They invented the lifestyle of the urban middle-class
dropout art-gypsy.  They invented its terminology and its
tactics.  They brought us the &ldquo;succes de scandale,&rdquo; the
now time-honored tactic of shocking one&rsquo;s audience all the
way to the bank.  And the &ldquo;succes d'estime,&rdquo; the edgy and
hazardous life of the critics' darling.  The doctrine of
art for art&rsquo;s sake was theirs too (thank you, Theophile
Gautier).  And the ever-helpful notion of <em>epater les
bourgeoisie,</em> an act of consummately modern rebellion
which is nevertheless impossible without a <em>bourgeoisie</em> to
<em>epater,</em> an act which the bourgeoisie itself has lavishly
financed for decades in our culture&rsquo;s premiere example of
Aldissian enantiodromia &ndash; the transformation of things
into their opposites. The Paris Bohemians were the first genuine
industrial-scale counterculture.  This was the culture
that created Jules Verne.  It deserves a great deal of the
credit or blame for origination of the genres of horror,
fantasy, and science fiction.  It has a legitimate claim
on our attention and our loyalties.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the experiences that <a href="http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Postfurry">PR and PV</a> have had that I&rsquo;m a bit jealous of, is that of encountering Bruce Sterling for the first time in the mid-90s. It&rsquo;s debatable whether that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d call &ldquo;the height of his powers,&rdquo; but the man has a powerful and bone-deep vision of possible futures that he is compelled to share (he also nicely illustrates that a solid knowledge of history is indispensable if you want to write science fiction). Encountering him in the 90s and seeing what he has to say about the Internet and counterculture, I can see why one might feel compelled to tell others, to share the vision. PR and PV have said in about so many words, that part of why postfurry is a thing, is Bruce Sterling. The vision persists.</p>

<p>It opens questions that make me shiver. I talked to someone recently and found out that I am not sure that postfurry has enough heft to sustain being written about, analyzed, explained. On the other hand, I have a deep and persistent feeling that there is something interesting and worthwhile there.</p>

<p>One of the habits of the furry subculture that troubles me is the fear of excluding people. It makes me squint suspiciously. You <a href="http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2010/01/this-presupposition-of-passivity.html">can&rsquo;t have a community unless you have a rule</a> for who&rsquo;s in and who&rsquo;s out. It needn&rsquo;t be phrased too harshly - but such a rule must exist. In a geographic community, the rule is easy: if you&rsquo;re here, you&rsquo;re in, if you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re out. But furry in general, because of its attachment to the Internet, and postfurry in particular, aims to be post-geographic. Thus, <em>some</em> rule is necessary - and if one is not consciously developed, one will de facto emerge from the community&rsquo;s id. I am not a fan of that prospect.</p>

<p>There are things to love about the furry subculture, and I love the postfurry community &mdash; but the future shape of a community is determined by the work invested in the present, and I&rsquo;m worried about that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a lot of reasons that you should care about Unicode. As someone who uses the web, you should know what it is and that representing human language is hard, and thus once in a while &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; and variations will show up. If you&rsquo;re someone who creates code or prose content for the web, you want to know a little more - I recommend <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s Unicode primer</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>Is there a style of garment more iconically late 20th/early 21st century than the hoodie? Worn by CEOs and street kids. Worn by teens who wanna look like cats and rappers who wanna look hard. Worn by punks and skaters and breakdancers and taggers and Occupy protesters and college kids and sports fans.

<p>Seth Godin is an ongoing source of inspiration to me. I have a nasty love-hate relationship with
advertising, but Godin does a great job of making me feel inspired about the great work of
persuasion. He&rsquo;s like the Scott McCloud of it: in the same way as re-reading McCloud&rsquo;s comics
trilogy makes me wave my hands and shout &ldquo;hooray comics!&rdquo;, Godin&rsquo;s work energizes me. He is also an
interesting kind of optimist: his work generally assumes that <em>you already have good ideas.</em> You
do. The challenge is turning good ideas into great ideas, which takes a lot of work, and persuading
others that your idea is great, which also takes a lot of work. But with Godin as my cheerleader, I
feel equipped to take that work on.</p>
