  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>This is how it works. I ride my bike down the street looking in apartment
windows until I see a TV set. I ride right next to the sidewalk, letting the
very hot air move over my arms and chest. When I see a TV set, big blue
square through the parted curtains and behind the translucency of the insect
screen, I reach behind me and unsling the biathlon rifle from my back.</p>

<p>Fucking sights are bouncing all over because it&rsquo;s a standing shot - always
hard - and my heart rate is way up. I wait for the old ticker to bump the
sight picture back up and snap it off. A gratifying &ldquo;glass rod breaking&rdquo; 4
pound trigger pull and I watch the TV go dark and listen to the screaming
from inside the apartment. One down.</p></blockquote>

<p>I used to read a lot of <a href="http://everything2.com">E2</a> and to write a bit there. It&rsquo;s an older chunk
of the Internet, and a younger me loved it. The story I&rsquo;m linking to is one that stirred up
proto-anarchist impulses me in, and is also just a great bit of short fiction. I go back and
re-read it every year or two; I strongly recommend that you do likewise. It is still relevant,
sadly. I expect that the part about TVs will become irrelevant much earlier than the part about the
police forces and the evil idiocy of the authoritarian state.</p>

<p>Both as a writer and as a reader, you are an archaeologist: you are constantly interrogating the
past. So I try to make a habit of pointing out things from the past&mdash;I had a strong LiveJournal
habit of doing that, and if you followed me on LJ in years gone, well, you&rsquo;ll probably see some of
the same pieces popping up again. They have remained sweet, bitter, and enlightening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today in chance encounters:</p>

<blockquote><p>And what about the calmly lascivious hayseed who provides the voice-over on the untitled funk
fragment that goes in its entirety: &ldquo;Maureen&rsquo;s got five sisters. They all got ass. One of &lsquo;em has
eyes as big as Jolly Ranchers. Beautiful girl, she&rsquo;s a beautiful girl.&rdquo; What the hell is
<strong>that,</strong> you wonder. What does &ldquo;eyes as big as Jolly Ranchers&rdquo; even mean? For that matter, what
does the whole track mean? Why is it here? Yet the guy and his trope are both so paradigmatic, so
weirdly normal, that after three or four plays you find yourself greeting it as warmly as the
hook of &ldquo;It Takes Two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But since one of the things that makes <strong>Endtroducing</strong> an art-rock record is its attention to
placement, there&rsquo;s no knowing whether the same bit would be as beguiling somewhere else. Its
organic absurdism follows a selection from Shadow&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;What Does Your Soul Look Like?&rdquo; and
right afterwards comes the lyrical first theme of the very multipartite &ldquo;Stem / Long Stem,&rdquo;
picked reflectively on a guitar or a keyb in drag. Heightened by the contrast, the theme&rsquo;s
yearning for the good and the beautiful is then accented with a triangle &mdash; only to be bombarded
a minute later by a drum-machine chain explosion, interrupted by a sub-Lenny Bruce monologue
about getting locked up in Long Beach (I now smack my lips over the strange phrase &ldquo;while I&rsquo;m
awaiting to be heard on my traffic offenses&rdquo;), then developed yet again. At 7:44, a nine-second
pause precedes a piano coda that you keep waiting to evolve into the theme track and never
does. And I&rsquo;m leaving stuff out. And that&rsquo;s just one track.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m describing is a highly potent species of musical structure […] Shadow didn&rsquo;t compose
these melodies, and [to] call them &ldquo;found&rdquo; would be too easy&mdash;&ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; maybe, although it&rsquo;s
more accurate to say they&rsquo;ve been accessed and reimagined. Because they&rsquo;re so anonymous, they
carry none of the wink-nudge intertextual referentiality of quoted bricolage, and though they&rsquo;re
nothing special to start with most of the time, they now give off the kind of direct aesthetic
emotion that&rsquo;s so hard to come by in this hyperconscious cultural era&mdash;an emotion you&rsquo;d hardly
expect to arise in such a formally pomo context. It&rsquo;s plain enough that Shadow loves the
disconcerting beats and impolite sounds of hip-hop and is no stranger to other ways of coping
with musical alienation. But it&rsquo;s just as plain that in his encyclopedic store of obscurities he
recognized dreams and aspirations from another cultural place, dreams that want nothing to do
with alienation except to vanquish it. I have no idea whether his ability to realize these dreams
is a promise of cultural health or a mark of individual genius.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Vulnerability is an underappreciated element of <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em>. For all that we readers enjoy
the fireworks of Calvin&rsquo;s adventures as Spaceman Spiff, his cardboard-box flights of imagination,
and in general his gleeful disregard for the mundane, these are all reactions to his state of
vulnerability. He&rsquo;s still just a kid: he doesn&rsquo;t quite get other people, nor the institutions that
they inhabit, nor a world beyond the parochial.</p>

<p>Watterson mentions in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0836204387/?tag=usefultigress-20">The Calvin &amp; Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book</a>
that the world of <em>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</em> works best on this small scale, hence the rarity of vacations,
family members besides the unnamed parents, or indeed any named cast members beyond a dozen or so
core figures. The world beyond this is opaque (which, as a side note, tends to translate into a
fertile ground for fanfiction and remix culture, hence the &ldquo;Calvin is Tyler Durden&rdquo; spiel and the
fanmade alternate endings for the strip) and unknowable. This also, though, emphasizes Calvin&rsquo;s
successes and failures because the world we readers see is, as a literary choice, happening at a
scale that emphasizes them. The throwaway references to geopolitics skip off the strip&rsquo;s surface
and vanish: they&rsquo;re not essential parts of the experience.</p>

<p>Calvin copes creatively with institutions and individuals that have coercive power over him, but
they still range from well-meaning-but-ineffectual to frighteningly apathetic to outright
hostile. I think that it&rsquo;s important to treasure both the whimsy, exploration, and inventiveness of
his world, as well as the fact that his creation of that world is driven by vulnerability to his
parents, to his school, and to the Other in general. As an adult, I&rsquo;ve started to empathize,
sometimes painfully, with his experience of a world of inscrutable institutions that don&rsquo;t do much
good that I can see and with the sense that my imaginary life, for all that I acknowledge that it&rsquo;s
mostly accessible to just me, is something that a terrifyingly indifferent world-system can&rsquo;t take
from me.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t stay a kid forever. That&rsquo;s part of why Watterson ended the strip. But learning to cope
with a sense of vulnerability, a sense that follows us through our lives, is something that you
might as well cultivate early.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was reminded that the &lsquo;90s are gone and cannot be recaptured.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is said that what is called &lsquo;the spirit of an age&rsquo; is something to which
one cannot return. That this spirit gradually dissipates is due to the
world&rsquo;s coming to an end. In the same way, a single year does not have just
spring or summer. A single day, too, is the same. For this reason, although
one would like to change today&rsquo;s world back to the spirit of one hundred
years or more ago, it cannot be done. Thus it is important to make the best
out of every generation. This is the mistake of people who are attached to
past generations; they have no understanding of this point. On the other
hand, people who only know the disposition of the present day and dislike the
ways of the past are too lax.
&ndash;Yamamoto Tsunemoto, <strong>Hagakure</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Release the past: let not the past <em>control</em> the present, but rather, let it
<em>inform</em> how you deal with the present. Being a prisoner of the unchanging,
unpitying past, is a fate that you should not choose for yourself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll hear me say, as though it didn&rsquo;t need explaining, &ldquo;Ronald Reagan was Satan&rsquo;s agent
on Earth.&rdquo;  I forget sometimes that this is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky%27s_political_views#Marginalization_in_the_mainstream_media">news from Neptune</a>
for a lot of people &mdash; sometimes because they are younger, sometimes because they simply haven&rsquo;t
heard. This post is about just one of the reasons that I have a deep loathing for Ronald Reagan:
because his administration perpetrated grave injustice and injury on the mentally ill, because
wounds inflicted by his hands have bled from then until the present day (causing tremendous amounts
of <em>preventable</em> death and misery), and because those policies are stealing from and endangering me
and those I care about.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after Reagan&rsquo;s inauguration in 1981,
<a href="http://www.miwatch.org/2011/02/_ronald_reagan_and_mental.html">ferocious cuts began</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Within a month, the Office of Management and Budget announced it would curtail the budget of the
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), phase out training of clinicians, interrupt research,
and eliminate services. Cutbacks to staff followed; chaos ensued. Experienced people left, others
remained in government service but were forced into menial jobs. Trained professionals were
reassigned to labs to dissect dead rats; science writers were reassigned to typing pools. The
Mental Health Systems Act would be disappear. Instead, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(1982) would merge money for mental health programs into block grants, and with fewer dollars
going to the states.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Block grants&rdquo; are a political instrument with a nasty legacy in the United States, and it&rsquo;s worth
taking a minute to explain how they work. In practice, they are a way to cut funding for things
that the federal government disapproves of, but with a layer of deniability over it such that no
one in Washington must admit to, for example, having cut funds for reproductive health, for
relieving poverty, or for pushing back against racism. They have the grim distinction of being used
for despicable ends in the hands of both Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<p>The mechanic goes like this: a great deal of the money that the US Federal government sends to the
states, comes with instructions. So many dollars here for highways, bridges, and tunnels, so many
dollars there for prisons, police, and courts. The funds are sometimes very specific and pedantic,
especially when it comes to money for helping to make the lives of marginalized populations
somewhat better. Such programs have a long history of having their funds stolen in one way or
another, so the pedantic directions were a form of defense against misappropriation. Block grants
come in the form of simplification: instead of so many little grants, their advocates say, we&rsquo;re
going to have the federal government make a bigger grant with few rules, and the state, being
closer to the problem, will be able to spend that money more efficiently than a patchwork of
potentially overlapping grants.</p>

<p>When you hear them speak of &ldquo;efficiency,&rdquo; beware.</p>

<p>In the case of block grants, &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; meant &ldquo;&hellip; and since we expect you to be more efficient,
we&rsquo;re going to take ten, fifteen, maybe twenty-five percent off the top.&rdquo; The result was a
viciously effective form of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s you and him fight,&rdquo; conducted at the level of state
politics. The efficiency gains promised by the advocates of block grants never materialized, and
the funding for projects aiding marginalized populations was always precarious
anyhow. Definitionally, the state of being &ldquo;marginalized&rdquo; is self-perpetuating &mdash; or rather, it&rsquo;s
a state of not being able to prevent others from perpetuating economic violence on you, of always
being the one without a chair when the music stops and of going unheard when you point out that
some people don&rsquo;t even stand up when the music starts. The practical upshot of block grants was
that programs for aiding marginalized populations were ruthlessly and repeatedly cut, and that the
projects that could afford the most lobbyists (which is to say, people whose agenda is to make the
rich richer and the poor poorer) suffered only negligible cuts.</p>

<p>Alongside people of color and queers, people struggling with mental health problems are one of the
(<em>many!</em>) perennially screwed marginalized populations in the USA &mdash; and the Reagan agenda
targeted that population specifically. Not that Reagan was anything like a benevolent president to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">people of color</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_UP">queer populations</a> or
<a href="http://bradhicks.livejournal.com/69802.html?format=light">people living in poverty</a> or
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307345424/?tag=usefultigress-20">women in general</a> &mdash; but
fortunately, those populations usually are pretty clear on Reagan&rsquo;s villainy and the injuries he
did to them particularly. People with mental health issues, on the other hand, especially people my
age and younger, are often unclear on Reagan&rsquo;s role and legacy.</p>

<p>This is not an abstract hatred, either: Reagan&rsquo;s policies <em>steal</em> from me and people I care about,
and have (speaking of just the domestic mental-health policies here) killed thousands who didn&rsquo;t
have to die, and may yet kill people close to me. The Reagan crowd&rsquo;s message to people with mental
illnesses and the people around them was: &ldquo;if you are suffering from mental health problems or are
supporting someone who is, the larger community doesn&rsquo;t owe you shit in terms of help, deal with it
yourself.&rdquo; They wanted those issues and those people to disappear, to just go away so they wouldn&rsquo;t
have to think about them.</p>

<p>Neither the issues nor the people will just &ldquo;go away,&rdquo; though, because <em>there is no &ldquo;away.&rdquo;</em> So the
costs of amelioration and treatment fall upon sufferers and their families and friends, who for as
much goodwill as we have, are not actually as good at that as mental health-care professionals (who
also became harder to get ahold of because Reagan attacked their ability to make a
living). Supporting the people we care about &mdash; we&rsquo;re all clear on this, right? &mdash; is not easy,
and certainly not free, and we cannot in good conscience refuse to do it. While mental health
professionals shouldn&rsquo;t handle everything, their role is vital, and everything that we do for those
we care about who endure mental health problems that really should be done by a professional, is a
form of stealing from us.</p>

<p>The policies of Reagan amounted to telling those of us with mental health problems and those of us
supporting them that we could expect no help. If you are not rich, the Reaganite morality said,
then you deserve to suffer. So burdens were added to those already burdened, those with the least
ability to fight against being further burdened. This was perpetrated on multiple levels: the
Reaganites also catalyzed the Pentagon&rsquo;s de facto policy of forbidding soldiers from being mentally
ill. Virtually every veteran with mental health problems, is not getting the help they need because
of Veteran&rsquo;s Administration policies instituted by Reagan. One of the great shames of the Pentagon
is its treatment of post-traumatic stress syndrome. Reagan, again.</p>

<p>The tragedy with Reagan, as Brad Hicks points out, is that after twelve years of his policies (his
vice-President simply continued his policies, man of withered conscience that he was), Clinton came
along and demonstrated that even if your views extend no further than the Beltway, the misery,
darkness, and cold of the Reagan years was never necessary at all. That made it into high tragedy
&mdash; that it was not just pain and death and privation, but pain and death and privation <em>for
nothing.</em></p>

<p>And all of that is without even getting into the misogyny that Reagan perpetuated, the hatred for
the poor, the racism, the wars, the lying about the wars, the fraud, the assassinations domestic
and foreign, the drugs (another good way to get me worked up is to get me started on the evil done
in the name of the War On Drugs). Read Chomsky if you want to see details and meticulously sourced
and footnoted evidence. For now, know that when I say that Ronald Reagan was Satan&rsquo;s agent on
Earth, I am quite serious and I say it as someone who the Reagan legacy has mugged and who has seen
her friends bleeding over and over again because Reagan&rsquo;s policies said that they didn&rsquo;t deserve
help. <strong>Fuck that guy.</strong></p>

<p>On the bright side, it&rsquo;s pretty hard for me to hate people because Reagan set the bar so high. So I
got that goin' for me. Which is nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just over five years ago, there was
<a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2007/02/liberating_iraq.html">a short essay called &ldquo;Liberating Iraq&rdquo;</a>
that resonated with me a great deal, and has informed a great deal of my thinking since then:</p>

<blockquote><p>During this conference, there was a recurring disagreement about the role of violence in fighting
deeply unjust regimes. On one side were the women from India, who argued against the use of
violence, generally on Gandhian grounds. On the other were many of the women who lived under
deeply unjust regimes; I recall, in particular, the South Africans arguing that however laudable
nonviolence might be, their situation was sufficiently desperate that they could not afford the
luxury of waiting for nonviolence to work.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that at the heart of this disagreement was this one fact: that the women from
India were from a country that had already achieved independence, and were living with the
problems that came afterwards, whereas the women from South Africa were trying to achieve that
self-government in the first place. The South Africans seemed to think that the women from India
had forgotten what it was like to be subjugated. <em>We need to win our freedom as quickly as
possible,</em> they seemed to say. <em>We realize that it would be preferable to win that freedom in the
best possible way. If we could win it just as quickly through non-violent means, we would surely
do so. But you would not ask us to wait if you really understood what it is like to live in
slavery.</em></p>

<p>By contrast, many of the arguments made by the Indians turned on the effects that achieving
self-government through violence had on one&rsquo;s own people. <em>Don&rsquo;t do this,</em> they seemed to be
saying: <em>once you win your freedom, you will find that you and your people have grown accustomed
to settling disputes by force and to demonizing your opponents. Think now about how to use the
struggle you are waging to teach yourselves how to become citizens and to practice
self-government. Do not wait until you win your independence to discover that self-government
requires not just political power, but political responsibility.</em></p>

<p>What made this argument so fascinating and painful to watch was that it was so easy to see both
points of view. Who could possibly deny the justice of either side? And yet I thought the Indian
women were right. I did not think that they had forgotten what it was like to be oppressed. I
thought they were warning the others off a mistake that they knew would be tragic, however
comprehensible it might be. So one thing I thought that the Indian women saw was this:</p>

<p><strong>Violence is not a way of getting where you want to go, only more quickly.</strong> Its existence
changes your destination. If you use it, you had better be prepared to find yourself in the kind
of place it takes you to.</p>

<p>And another was this: <strong>liberation is not just a matter of removing an oppressive government.</strong>
It can seem that way when you live under tyranny. Nothing is more comprehensible than people
living in apartheid South Africa, or under Saddam, thinking: if only that government were removed
from power, things would be better. They would have to be. After all, how could they possibly be
worse?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are almost always ways in which things could be worse.</p></blockquote>

<p>Methodologies and tactics are important: the destination can&rsquo;t be fully separated from the means
used to make the journey. This is something that worries me considerably when I look at Tumblr and
its social-justice advocacy crowd. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not the foremost thing to worry about - but
it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind because one of the surest ways to take tactical roads that can&rsquo;t lead to
the desired destination, is to ignore that possibility.</p>

<p>Putting it another way: when we strive to overthrow a toxic structure (of any kind!), we contend
with the Scylla of ineffectual action and the Charybdis of overthrowing the toxic structure and
then immediately re-creating it. Both are more than capable of devouring us and our
fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is almost no-one in the social-justice movement advocating violence itself. I am
acquainted with anarchists who are willing to raise the possibility, but who rightly find it very
suspect, and while I identify as part of the anarcho-whateverist spectrum, generally that crowd
isn&rsquo;t the crowd we&rsquo;re talking when we talk about &ldquo;the social-justice movement.&rdquo; What worries me is
that the social-justice crowd is willing to use tactics that do not demonstrate a commitment to its
professed values.</p>

<p>One of the most important things that the Internet has offered those of us striving for a better
world, is relief from isolation. When I first found the blogs and discussions of these topics, I
was hugely relieved: <em>it&rsquo;s not just me: these problems are real!</em> And there were people that I
could talk to who <em>took it for granted</em> that the problems were real and important and urgent, where
you didn&rsquo;t have to trudge yet again through pointing out that women are human, patriarchy exists,
and the US Government lies routinely. You could just start the discussion there and talk about how
it impacts your life, how you feel about it, and what to do about it.</p>

<p>This is a powerful thing drawing folks to the Tumblr scene: I see many people having that exulting,
joyful, mind-warping transformation, having their lives and selves and lived experiences
validated. It is a powerful thing. But like many ecstatic experiences, it&rsquo;s hard to dryly <em>explain</em>
it to someone who has not had it - and to inhabit it all the time, is counterproductive.</p>

<p>I notice this most with anger. Anger at the Current Arrangement is valid and healthy: without it no
one would be striving for change in any direction. It is likewise important to have a place for
that anger: if you cannot speak the anger, you&rsquo;re carrying Buddha&rsquo;s hot coal. So that&rsquo;s another
good thing that the Internet does for those striving for change: it has many places where it is
safe to speak your anger, radiantly, passionately, with all your pain and tears and rage and blood
and claws and fangs and hoarse throat and scraped skin and aching head. Places where you don&rsquo;t have
to be <em>sorry</em> for pointing out your own pain, pointing out how fucked-up the world can be, pointing
out how much pain someone can cause by not seeing you as a real person.</p>

<p>That voice is crucially important. That voice, however, is not the voice of persuasion. Persuasion,
especially when we venture into Sinclair-esque &ldquo;It is difficult to get a man to understand
something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!&rdquo; zones, is very, very
difficult. I have a theory that many people who have been held down by the Current Arrangement as
though by the heavy lid of a giant cast-iron slow-cooker pot, find the places where it is safe to
be angry, safe to hurt, safe to <em>be</em> instead of unsafe to exist as one&rsquo;s own self, and say: <em>why
should I again hide my anger, my pain, my own self?</em></p>

<p>Because, tragic as it is, that doesn&rsquo;t persuade people.</p>

<p>Persuading people who don&rsquo;t already agree with you is hard enough that it is called by science&rsquo;s
dryly humorous term &ldquo;Outstanding Problem In The Field.&rdquo; Simplifying tremendously, we are unlikely
to change our opinions in a vacuum because it&rsquo;s expensive, likely to rationalize whatever we&rsquo;re
already doing in terms of our professed beliefs, and unlikely to change our opinions when we&rsquo;re not
applying our rational-verbal-analytical minds to doing so. A rational-verbal-analytical mind is
costly to operate, so most of the time we don&rsquo;t do that. This is why, for example, the economics
profession erred so greatly in assuming that humans are rational economic actors: we kinda-sorta
are in aggregate and over significant time, but when it comes to individuals in day-to-day life
we&rsquo;re not at all purely rational utility-seekers; we&rsquo;re just people, people who can be fatigued,
frightened, and rushed.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s a major part of why it&rsquo;s so hard to persuade us: most of the time we&rsquo;re not
persuadeable. Persuasion stems from trust, safety, and calm. It&rsquo;s tricky to create these
conditions, and the most reliable routes take quite a bit of time. Part of why &ldquo;we&rsquo;re here, we&rsquo;re
queer, get used to it&rdquo; worked so well for the queer-rights movement despite its confrontational
tone was that it took advantage of this dynamic: once someone was here and visibly queer for long
enough, people did get used to it. People saw that queers are just another group of people, not the
frightening and mysterious Other. The success that I would really like hasn&rsquo;t arrived, but the
trend is clear and positive.</p>

<p>An aside: as with the post about escalation, I am not advocating that you do or cease doing any
particular thing. I am advocating that you adopt my view of the risks of certain behaviors and
adapt that to your own particular circumstances; I accept that doing that in goodwill, will
probably lead to decisions that would make me say WTF, because your circumstances are not mine and
I can&rsquo;t fully know them because I&rsquo;m not you.</p>

<p>The Tumblosphere in particular, likely because its demographics trend young, tends to have a strong
dose of this. It comes in form of &ldquo;wait a minute, shouldn&rsquo;t my being <em>right</em> be enough to persuade
people?&rdquo; When you say this,
<a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020275838_boeingoutsourcingxml.html">a thousand grizzled engineers shake their heads ruefully</a>,
remembering the times when that didn&rsquo;t work for telling management what&rsquo;s right; a thousand
politicians do likewise, thinking of their campaigns, and so too do a thousand evangelists,
activists, and salesfolk. Persuasion is totally (and tragically: this is why Cassandra is
interesting) unrelated to being right.</p>

<p>Ideally, having the affirming, supportive space that Internet social connections give, would give
us a stable place on which to stand, from which we can build a way of persuading people who do not
experience the same pain to work together with us to build a better world. We fail, though, if we
take the voice of anger and pain out of that safe space and use it to shout at those people. Again,
this is not to say that the anger is unmerited, but only that it is not persuasive, for the same
reason that you don&rsquo;t talk to your boss at a meeting the way you talk to your friends over coffee -
and for the same reason that you probably don&rsquo;t like it when other people are shouting at you with
the voice of anger and pain.</p>

<p>I believe that it&rsquo;s crucially important that we continue to support one another, to create safe
spaces, and to give people a space to legitimately and productively speak with voices of anger and
pain. Yet at the same time we will have failed if that is is the only thing we do or the only voice
we empower people to speak with. When we are pulled between that Scylla and Charybdis of
ineffectuality and self-subversion, we must use a wide variety of tactics to preserve ourselves and
our ideals.</p>

<p>On the whole, I&rsquo;m optimistic about Internet communities of activists, deviants, and strivers for
better worlds of various kinds. They subject many ideas to a harsh but necessary test of survival
in the small. If I can&rsquo;t build a vibrant Internet community of any size on my ideas, can&rsquo;t build a
circle of a couple dozen talkative people improving their lives with my ideas, can&rsquo;t build a chatty
long-term email thread of friends debating my ideas and enjoying them, then my ideas certainly have
not hope in the larger world. Of course there&rsquo;s flex: not every idea that has a small passionate
Internet community is destined for mass-audience traction. But if an idea can roam the Internet and
not find any community at all, that&rsquo;s a profoundly bad sign for its future as a mass-audience
making-a-better-world idea.</p>

<p>We in the social-justice advocacy stream of thought fail when we make our ideals into just another
form of tribalism, when we adopt and enforce rigid hierarchies among ourselves, when we assume that
just because we&rsquo;re right, others will be persuaded towards our vision of a better world. Our
challenge is to balance our mutual support, our places where it&rsquo;s safe to express anger and pain
without fear of being punished for being vulnerable, with the practical necessity of persuading
others towards solving the problems we see by the courses that our ideals demand.</p>

<p>These are both very challenging things! They&rsquo;re ridiculously hard, and many of us say to them &mdash;
<em>I am already weary from my anger and pain, how is it that I am expected to take on this task as
well?</em> That is a totally reasonable dismay to be stricken with. But the task is ours, us in the
social-justice line of thought, because the vision is ours: if someone else does the work of social
change, they will work towards their vision. This is another reason that our infrastructure of
mutual support is so important: we acknowledge that the pain can come from one another, and we work
towards our own community modeling the solutions we&rsquo;d like to see enacted in the world at large.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;d like to use the Internet controversy of the week &mdash; particularly,
<a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2013/03/adria-richards-does-belong-at-tech.html">Melissa McEwan&rsquo;s response</a> to it &mdash; to talk about something that&rsquo;s been on my mind for a while: escalation. I believe that the changes in our communications environment, particularly mass access to broadcast-style media and the possibility of things &ldquo;going viral,&rdquo; have made it very easy to escalate problems, and that people should invest more thought and caution into a decision to escalate, and should have better de-escalation toolkits.</p>

<p>To vastly, vastly oversimplify, <a href="https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/">the incident that people are talking about</a> went like so: at PyCon, a developer conference, two dudes were cracking dick jokes, a woman sitting near them posted a picture of them to Twitter with a &ldquo;not cool, stop that&rdquo; message, an escalation spiral occurred, and all three of the people involved got fired. There&rsquo;s lots to read about this incident, but I&rsquo;m going to pick on a micro slice of it: the decision to publicly shame people instead of speaking to them &mdash; that is, the decision to escalate.</p>

<p>Escalation is part of our communication/relationship/group-interaction toolkit; I will not say that it is a bad thing. What I will say is that it is a tool that&rsquo;s good for some things, but not for others, and that it is a tool that you should handle with the same caution that you give to, say, a power sander. It should never be a tool of first resort &mdash; but it should never be a tool that is denied to people.</p>

<p>As a working definition of escalation, let&rsquo;s consider &ldquo;expanding the scope of a conflict.&rdquo; One easy example is <em>ad hominem</em> attacks: when the argument expands from being about proposals to also being about the personal characteristics of one or more participants. Another example is the fallacy with the charming name of <em>argumentum ad baculum</em> &mdash; the appeal to force. When someone demands that they prevail in an argument because of force rather than reason, they have escalated that argument. We can consider also the incident in which Rob Schneider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuce_Bigalow:_European_Gigolo#Reception">responded to a negative review</a> of a movie that he starred in by taking out a full-page ad to respond denigrating the critic. When a disagreement may be public or private, and someone chooses to move into the public sphere, they have escalated that disagreement.</p>

<p>The reason that escalation is a useful and problematic tool is that all of these things <em>change people&rsquo;s responses.</em> Expanding the scope of a conflict puts it in a different context, related to the new scope, and that context informs people&rsquo;s responses. This is emphatically not the same as &ldquo;puts people on their best behavior.&rdquo; Focusing on the case of escalating a private disagreement to the public sphere, it should be very clear that people act differently in public and in private. This is where we encounter the effects of changes in our communication environment: it&rsquo;s as easy as it ever was to escalate arguments by insults or by force, but it used to be much more difficult to make a dispute public. Someone fluent with the Internet&rsquo;s communications affordances can make something public very quickly indeed, and with the cooperation of others, it can be made very, very public.</p>

<p>This is dangerous; <strong>escalation is not always a good idea.</strong> Escalation is usually a sign of &ldquo;the terms on which this conflict is being conducted, are unfavorable to me, so I&rsquo;m going to change them.&rdquo; Escalation occurs in a social context. Escalation is very easy now, and will not become less easy with the communications environment we&rsquo;ve chosen for ourselves, so we have to develop a &ldquo;social technology&rdquo; that tells people when it&rsquo;s appropriate to escalate. As the the PyCon incident illustrates, very often <a href="https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/">escalation results in everyone losing</a>, like a mutual-betrayal scenario in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a>.</p>

<p>I am not going to attempt to give comprehensive advice about when to escalate: part of why escalation is a tricky technique is that it&rsquo;s quite difficult to decide when to escalate. What I am going to do, is to urge you to think carefully before escalating, and to never escalate just because it&rsquo;s easy to escalate. We are all prone to human failures of thought that are very likely to happen when something goes from public to private, and which things like Twitter give us plenty of room to indulge. Good Guys and Bad Guys will be assigned, regardless of whether the debate at hand admits the existence of clear-cut Good and Bad. People will dig in their heels when they are arguing in front of people whose goodwill they value: they will be less likely to back down. People not previously involved in the argument will <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2008/10/08/false-witnesses-2/">feel compelled to weigh in and establish that they are on the side of Right and Good and Truth</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things that makes people prone to escalation, is a failure to identify the urgency of a situation. False urgency drives us all to make bad decisions; it is a specific flavor of fear. It can be overcome, but it takes effort, and one&rsquo;s personal life is generally better when it contains as few people as possible who are prone to identifying the non-urgent as urgent. People who feel safe, confident, and at ease, rarely escalate, which is part of why I think that those things should be afforded to everyone. On the flip side, people who feel threatened, insecure, and agitated, are prone to escalation.</p>

<p>One thing that I think is a very clever use of escalation&rsquo;s virtues is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holla_Back">Holla Back</a> inititative. It correctly identifies that a particular argument is unwinnable in its &ldquo;native&rdquo; context (i.e. &ldquo;street harassment is fine&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fucking harass people&rdquo;) and shifts the context. It takes advantage of the difference between what people will do in anonymous crowds, and what they are willing to be held accountable for. It evades difficulties of escalation because there is rarely an existing social bond between harassers and victims in this context. It&rsquo;s a very deft use of escalation: it specifically says &ldquo;here is a situation where escalation is an appropriate response, and here are tools to make it easy and a social framing to make it acceptable.&rdquo; All of the components there are important: escalation isn&rsquo;t always an appropriate response, and independently, it&rsquo;s not always socially acceptable.</p>

<p>If you read the <a href="http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/">first-person account</a> of Adria Richards, the woman who reported the PyCon incident, it seems like she&rsquo;s pretty clearly basing her response on the Holla Back model. It did not work out well. This illustrates a further difficulty of escalation: it invites escalation in return, and de-escalation is almost always more difficult than escalation. Escalation&rsquo;s expansion of scope requires an expansion of commitment &mdash; even if a participant feels like they have not become more committed, if they are still in the argument, they&rsquo;re committed to a bigger argument. In this case, the public nature of the argument drew in other participants, who escalated (e.g. by firing people) and comments from the peanut gallery (some awful, awful Reddit/Hacker News threads on the matter). It is a good illustration of the dangers of escalation.</p>

<p>Escalation is only a tool. Like a hammer, it is good at some things, bad at others, and in the process of using it for either you may hurt yourself by using it inexpertly. In your own life, I urge you to reject false urgency, to never use escalation as a first resort, and to critically examine any conflict you&rsquo;re involved in for attempts to escalate it without your consent.</p>

<hr />

<p>Edit: I disavow the view that Adria Richards <em>should</em> have acted differently: the whole point of this spiel is that escalation is hard. If I said that or seemed to say that, I was wrong, I wanted to address escalation as a phenomenon, not her in particular. About her case in particular, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/deannazandt/2013/03/22/why-asking-what-adria-richards-could-have-done-differently-is-the-wrong-question/">Deanna Zandt</a> has a great writeup with links to other insightful pieces.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2008/06/a-mind-dismembered/?single=1">&ldquo;No one is entirely sure when magical penis loss first came to Africa,&rdquo;</a> but it&rsquo;s a recurring problem. It&rsquo;s also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koro_%28medicine%29">koro</a>, and it&rsquo;s fascinating to me for a couple of reasons.</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the paper, a young man named Wasiu Karimu was on a bus when he “was said to have let
out a strident cry, claiming that his genital organ had disappeared. He immediately grabbed
[Funmi] Bello, who was seated next to him, and shouted that the woman should restore his ‘stolen’
organ.” They got off the bus, and a crowd of “miscreants” swarmed around the woman, ready to kill
her.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s one example of how it&rsquo;s said to happen; here is another.</p>

<blockquote><p>The stranger had stopped to purchase a cup of tea at the market. After handing over his money, he
clasped the vendor’s hand. The tea seller felt an electric tingling course through his body and
immediately sensed that his penis had shrunk to a size smaller than that of a baby’s. His yells
quickly drew a crowd. Somehow in the fray a second man fell victim as well. [&hellip;] Shortly after
the disturbance in the Tiringoulou market, members of the armed rebel group that governs the town
arrested the traveler and subjected him to a harsh interrogation—for his own protection, they
told me later. Had they left him to the mob, the town’s women would have torn the stranger limb
from limb, they reasoned. But the protection, such as it was, did not last long: the supposed
thief was executed by gunshot later that day.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first quote is from <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2008/06/a-mind-dismembered/?single=1">&ldquo;A Mind Dismembered&rdquo;</a> in Harper&rsquo;s, the second from <a href="http://www.psmag.com/magazines/march-april-2013/genital-theft-africa-central-african-republic-53341/">&ldquo;Missing Pieces: Africa&rsquo;s genital-stealing crime wave hits the countryside&rdquo;</a> in the Pacific Standard. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/976.htm">roundup of stories about a 2003 incident</a> assembled by <acronym title="Middle East Media Research Institute">MEMRI</acronym>, and there are more citations in the sources list for the Wikipedia article on koro. What interests me about penis theft is not so much what it says about Africa as what it says about America and about the human experience in general. Resist the temptation to just think &ldquo;wow they belive some crazy stuff over there,&rdquo; and instead notice the context, the subtext, the relationships. <em>Why</em> do people believe what they believe?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s turn away from Africa for a minute and think about America&rsquo;s relationship with witchcraft. Now, I&rsquo;m a wacko far leftist, a delicate San Francisco hothouse flower, so my first reaction when someone says that is &ldquo;wait, <em>what</em> relationship with witchcraft?&rdquo; followed by thoughts about modern neopaganism and 17th-century Salem. So I was fairly surprised, a few years back, when a vice-presidential candidate headed for a national election <a href="http://maxblumenthal.com/2008/09/the-witch-fighter-anoints-palin/">sought the blessings of a witch-fighter</a>. People in my social sphere tend to laugh at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_tract#Views_on_Satanism_and_Satanic_Influence">Chick tracts</a>, too, but Chick tracts don&rsquo;t appear from nowhere. Someone believes that there are witches, Satanists, and Freemasons busily conspiring against the God-Bless-the-United-States-of-America &mdash; a lot of someones, in fact ( <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/06/28/rise-of-the-planet-of-the-satanazis/">&ldquo;Planet Of The Satanazis&rdquo;</a> is a good roundup).</p>

<p>It is trivial to show that this sort of thing is not just false, but outrageously false &mdash; as the saying goes, violates important laws of physics. If that were all there were to it, you could just show people a few solid debunkings on Snopes and they&rsquo;d get the point. But you can&rsquo;t. Fred Clark <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2008/09/08/false-witnesses/">has an interesting account</a> of this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I had a much-photocopied dossier in my desk drawer from the Procter &amp; Gamble corporation. This
surreal document was the company’s response to the urban legend that [&hellip;] the CEO of P&amp;G had at
some vague point in the recent past appeared on some talk show &ndash; Phil Donahue, or Sally Jesse,
or Oprah, the story mutated and adapted over time &ndash; and declared that he was a Satanist and that
a portion of the company’s profits were donated regularly to the Church of Satan. This is a
mind-bogglingly silly story. It’s not just implausible, but inconceivable, impossible. It is
unbelievable on its face for dozens of reasons that become clear from even a moment’s
consideration, and it’s based on factual claims that are easy to check on and quickly
disproved. [&hellip;] Procter &amp; Gamble had prepared the dossier to combat this rumor [&hellip;] they had
also collected an impressive array of letters from religious leaders — the archbishop of
Cincinnati, Billy Graham, Jerry Falwell, among others — all of whom urged their followers not to
believe this stupid, stupid lie. In retrospect, this desperate, shotgun appeal to religious
authority demonstrated why the dossier itself was probably futile. It was an acknowledgment that
the people they were attempting to convince were beyond the reach of mere fact or reason —
<strong>people who did not find reality compelling.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Now that&rsquo;s quite a phrase, isn&rsquo;t it? <em>&ldquo;People who do not find reality compelling.&rdquo;</em> With the important caveat that we&rsquo;re talking about specific viewpoints people hold, rather than about people&rsquo;s global &ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo; scores, let&rsquo;s talk about why people might believe these things. Fred Clark has a theory in a <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2008/10/08/false-witnesses-2/">follow-up post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The kitten-burners seem to fulfill some urgent need. They give us someone we can clearly and
correctly say we&rsquo;re better than. Their extravagant cruelty makes us feel better about ourselves
because we know that we would never do what they have done. Kitten-burners are particularly
useful in this role because their atrocious behavior seems wholly alien and without any
discernible motive that we might recognize in ourselves. Their cruelty seems both arbitrary and
unrewarding, allowing us to condemn it without reservation. I mentioned that the Church of Satan
aspect of the Procter &amp; Gamble rumor seemed a bit too outrageous and over-the-top. But while that
outrageousness makes the story less plausible, it&rsquo;s also what makes it so compelling. The pride
that fuels [this kind of] morality is an addictive drug, and the mythological Satan-worshippers
of the P&amp;G rumor offer that drug in its purest form. This story has nothing to do with any actual
religion or cult or the actual doctrines espoused by Anton LaVey or any other publicity-seeking
character who has claimed the name of Satanism. It&rsquo;s about the <em>idea</em> of Satanism — the lore and
legends of this enduringly popular bogeyman. Satanist stories, much like stories about ghosts or
vampires, tap into big mythic fears – the sense that there is real evil in the world, that the
innocent often suffer, that we may be powerless against the powerful. We tell such stories
because we are afraid — reasonably afraid — of powerful, unnameable things. These stories give
those fears a shape and a name and a horrifying face, and somehow that can be more reassuring
than allowing such fears to remain amorphous and existential. And just like vampire and ghost
stories, Satanist stories have their own sets of rules, details and basic outlines with which
we&rsquo;re all familiar. These give the stories their own kind of reality. (Ask most people, &ldquo;Do you
believe in vampires?&rdquo; and they will answer No. But ask those same people if vampires can be
killed with a wooden stake and they&rsquo;ll tell you Yes.)</p></blockquote>

<p>This is where we turn back to the penis thieves. I am no expert on African history, culture, and psychogeography, but the theory from the Harper&rsquo;s and Pacfic Standard articles seems plausible enough to me: no penises (or other body parts) are actually being stolen, but rather, fears are being expressed. I find <em>&ldquo;the sense that there is real evil in the world, that the innocent often suffer, that we may be powerless against the powerful&rdquo;</em> a totally normal thing to think - partially because those are enduring worries of the human condition, and partially because we live in 2013, in a world that <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/12/invaders-from-mars.html">can reasonably be described as the aftermath of an alien invasion</a>. It is also normal to think if you live in Africa, which has for perhaps the last thousand years been experiencing the business end of a succession of empires, the destiny of African nations not quite their own.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that particular fears being universal to the human experience <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2008/10/10/they-need-help/">does not make them true</a> nor does it say anything about whether or not we will react to them in a healthy way. Fear, indeed, makes us much more likely to react in unhealthy, destructive, and evil ways: we are all disposed to make worse decisions when we are afraid. In the penis-theft hysteria, this shows up as mob violence, and in the case of Americans terrified of Satanists, it also shows up as voting for people who, ironically, would be a lock for the endorsement of the actual LaVey-lineage Church of Satan.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day we&rsquo;re all not-particularly-bright monkeys, the American Christian authoritarian/evangelical movement&rsquo;s fears have the same roots as the fears of the afflicted Nigerian urbanites and Central African Republic villagers. They are not the same fears, but they have the same roots. <em>The world is spinning out of control and no one can stop it,</em> you can hear them muttering. <em>Virtue is disappearing and dangerous foreigners are everywhere.</em> These fears filter through the time and place that we find them in.</p>

<p>The very fact that the penis thefts are sexualized, outrageous, and distant from the everyday experience of Americans makes them a good lens on home-grown American fears that are sexualized and outrageous. It is trivial to show that a great many Americans believe things that are just as credible as penis thefts - the easiest example is the moral panic that Christian leaders tend to stir up about transgender folks' use of public restrooms. Their worries are pure urban legend - they do not pass the sniff test, the laugh test, or the five-minutes-of-Google-searching test. That&rsquo;s because these are about fear, not about reason, and if you try to appeal to their reason, you&rsquo;ll be up against &ldquo;people who do not find reality compelling&rdquo; again.</p>

<p>We are brushing up against an argument that goes back to Socrates here: persuasion is not inherently about reason. In ideal circumstances, people would be swayed only by appeals to reason, but such circumstances are rare, so the normal course of persuasion is emotional appeal and various shortcuts that range from simply eliding an argument that you&rsquo;re confident you can prove to patently lying. This feature of human psychology is on full display in Fred Clark&rsquo;s story about attempting to disprove the Satanist urban legend. Clark says:</p>

<blockquote><p>In trying to combat the P&amp;G slander with nothing more than irrefutable facts proving it false, I
was operating under a set of false assumptions. Among these:</p>

<ol>
<li>I assumed that the people who claimed to believe that Procter &amp; Gamble supported the Church of
Satan really did believe such a thing.</li>
<li>I assumed that they were passing on this rumor in good faith — that they were misinforming
others only because they had, themselves, been misinformed.</li>
<li>I assumed that they would respect, or care about, or at least be willing to consider, the
actual facts of the matter.</li>
<li>Because the people spreading this rumor claimed to be horrified/angry about its allegations, I
assumed that they would be happy/relieved to learn that these allegations were, indisputably,
not true.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of those assumptions proved to be false [&hellip;] They did not respect, or care about, the actual
facts of the matter, except to the extent that they viewed such facts with <em>hostility</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>You could make a parallel set of assumptions about people who buy into penis thievery, and I would lay down a sawbuck on your getting the same reactions from them that Clark did from the people whose fears he attempted to debunk. There is also a strong parallel to <a href="http://rantagainsttherandom.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/why-i-wont-publish-your-comments-about-false-rape-accusations/">the false-rape-accusation chimera</a>, where people who claim to be very worried about a specific problem are anything but happy to hear that the problem is multiple orders of magnitude smaller than they claim it is. In both the cases of the Christian authoritarians' hysterics about queers in bathrooms and the anti-feminists' horror of false accusations of rape, I encourage you to visit those claims with the scrutiny that you visit naturally upon the fears of penis theft. Are they glad to hear that their fears are unfounded, or are they acting like &ldquo;people who do not find reality compelling&rdquo;?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other">Other</a> the anti-feminists and the Christian authoritarians any more than I want to declare myself a superior being to those driven to mob violence by the penis-theft hysteria: I too am human, I experience fear, I am painfully aware that the world is very large and not very caring. At the same time, though, what I&rsquo;m trying to point out here is that no one who tries to correct the errors of those three groups will get very far by appealing only to reason. Reason did not convince them that scary queers, false rape accusers, and penis thieves, were terrifying problems. Fear convinced them, fear produced by the state of the world &mdash; and, as often as not, fear driven to great heights by people who sensed that they could make a quick buck from the fear-addled (this dynamic is especially prominent in the case of Christian authoritarians, whose history as scam victims goes back a very long way). The term of art for these fears is that they are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"><em>non-falsifiable</em></a> - there is no way to conclusively prove or disprove them. You are more likely to get a response like &ldquo;oh my god, Snopes is part of the conspiracy too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;d like to invite you to consider the people trapped by their fear of such imaginary monsters with compassion, to consider the broad context of their fears, and to engage them with empathy. For those of us who wish that reason alone was enough to cure them of fear, there is a trap: thinking that, since we able to see by reason that that particular fear is fear of a non-existent thing, we are <em>better</em> than them. Even more difficult than reasoning people out of fear is reasoning people out of any position if they think that you hold them in contempt.</p>

<p>Sara Robinson had an excellent quartet of articles a few years back (<a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/08/tunnels-and-bridges-part-i-divide-and.html">1</a>, <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/08/tunnels-and-bridges-part-ii-nothing-to.html">2</a>, <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/08/tunnels-and-bridges-part-iii-bigger.html">3</a>, <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/09/tunnels-and-bridges-part-iv-landing.html">4</a>) about people escaping from these fears in a larger context of life change. They make excellent reading, and emphasize the role of empathy and outreach to people trapped in worlds full of invisible monsters no more substantial than the penis thieves. The world <em>is</em> full of scary things - but reacting with violence, xenophobia, and hatred in the manner of the Christian authoritarians, the anti-feminists, and the mobs chasing after the penis thieves, never makes the world better. We make the world better instead with empathy, with compassion, and with lifting one another up. It is not easy, but it builds a better world one day at a time, whereas fear is a foundation of sand, on which nothing enduring will stand.</p>
