  <div class="entry-content"><p>My pal Paka has a great point about <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Okay, so <strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong> ends with the heroes failing miserably. They <strong>win,</strong> but
they do so failing. Han basically dies, keeping Chewie from losing his temper and getting Leia
killed in the process. Luke basically suicides but he doesn&rsquo;t join the Dark Side. And Lando, I&rsquo;ve
realized, gives up everything rather than being a nice little stoolie.</p>

<p>Think about this for a bit. Han has nothing to lose other than his life, two friends, and a ship
which has already been impounded. Luke would lose his ethics at the price of very probably
helping Vader kill Palpatine and at some point killing Vader and becoming Emperor himself. It
makes me grind teeth to realize that Leia is sort of The Obligatory Woman and doesn&rsquo;t really get
a character moment like that. Lando loses the most. He&rsquo;s been hoping this whole time that if he
plays nice with the legal authorities (and note here, he&rsquo;s one of three Black guys you ever see
in that universe, so he&rsquo;s the minority made good in a system run by crusty white rich people),
they&rsquo;ll let him have his business and his friends can make bail, and then the deal gets worse and
worse and worse. Lando could potentially accept worse and worse and worse and he&rsquo;d still come out
of it with a retirement plan, health care, stock options, and enough income to keep himself in
Colt 40 and awesome capes for the rest of his life. Things which he probably didn&rsquo;t have quite
that much of before when he was Lando scraping by on gambling. And boom, it&rsquo;s all gone because
being Lando freaking Calrissian is at the end way more important to him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lando Calrissian has always complicated the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. I like
Paka&rsquo;s reading here quite a bit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was struck recently by how <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060512806/?tag=usefultigress-20">Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s Cryptonomicon</a> has remained
relevant. Here&rsquo;s one of my favorite passages.</p>

<blockquote><p>Men who believe that they are accomplishing something by speaking speak in a different way from
men who believe that speaking is a waste of time. Bobby Shaftoe has learned most of his practical
knowledge&mdash;how to fix a car, butcher a deer, throw a spiral, talk to a lady, kill a Nip&mdash;from
the latter type of man. For them, trying to do anything by talking is like trying to pound in a
nail with a screwdriver. Sometimes you can even see the desperation spread over such a man&rsquo;s face
as he listens to himself speak.</p>

<p>Men of the other type, the ones who use speech as a tool of their work, who are confident and
fluent, aren&rsquo;t necessarily more intelligent, or even more educated. It took Shaftoe a long time
to figure that out. Anyway, everything was neat and tidy in Bobby Shaftoe&rsquo;s mind until he met two
of the men in Detachment 2702: Enoch Root and Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse. [He began] to
suspect that there might be a third category of man, a kind so rare that Shaftoe never met any of
them until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the word &lsquo;addict&rsquo; because it has terrible connotations,&rdquo; Root says one day, as they
are sunning themselves on the afterdeck. &ldquo;Instead of slapping a label on you, the Germans would
describe you as &lsquo;Morphiums√ºchtig.&rsquo; The verb &lsquo;suchen&rsquo; means to seek. So that might be translated,
loosely, as &lsquo;morphine seeky&rsquo; or even more loosely as &lsquo;morphine seeking.&rsquo; I prefer &lsquo;seeky&rsquo; because
it means that you have an inclination to seek morphine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the fuck are you talking about?&rdquo; Shaftoe says.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you have a roof with a hole in it. That means it is a leaky roof. It&rsquo;s leaky all
the time even if it&rsquo;s not raining at the moment. But it&rsquo;s only leaking when it happens to be
raining. In the same way, morphine seeky means that you always have this tendency to look for
morphine, even if you are not looking for it at the moment. But I prefer both of them to
&lsquo;addict,&rsquo; because they are adjectives modifying Bobby Shaftoe instead of a noun that obliterates
Bobby Shaftoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; Shaftoe asks. He asks this because he is expecting Root to give him an
order, which is usually what men of the talkative sort end up doing after jabbering on for a
while. But no order seems to be forthcoming, because that&rsquo;s not Root&rsquo;s agenda. Root just felt
like talking about words. [&hellip;] Waterhouse never gives direct orders, so men of the first
category don&rsquo;t know what to make of him. But apparently men of the second category fare no
better; such men usually talk like they have an agenda in their heads and they are checking off
boxes as they go, but Waterhouse&rsquo;s conversation doesn&rsquo;t go anywhere in particular. He speaks, not
as a way of telling you a bunch of stuff he&rsquo;s already figured out, but as a way of making up a
bunch of new shit as he goes along. And he always seems to be hoping that you&rsquo;ll join in. Which
no one ever does, except for Enoch Root.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are two things that I find compelling about this incident. One is that people&rsquo;s relationships
to words and meaning is a leitmotif of the book, and this moment makes explicit (as opposed to
demonstrating) that as Bobby Shaftoe does, you can live a satisfying life without getting deeply
into word-games and syntactic manipulation. The world around you is available to you directly:
abstractions are not the only valid way to engage with it. Randy, another protagonist, by contrast
worries that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;too much of a Platonist&rdquo; and spends a lot of time introspecting as he
participates in a plot to build a digital currency founded on cryptography&mdash;on meaning selectively
obscured.</p>

<p>The basic setup of the book, where one set of characters are attempting to jumpstart a digital,
crypto-based currency and are harassed by the US Government, should definitely remind you of
BitCoin, other digital currency experiments, and the particular tactics which the 2000-2013
government of the United States uses to retain power. That part&rsquo;s
easy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian">A government that demands ability to participate in every aspect of civic and private life</a>,
necessarily reacts with great hostility to the idea that people might have real privacy at all, let
alone a right to it. There has been plenty of ink spilled about this, so I&rsquo;ll leave off for the
moment.</p>

<p>The other way in which this passage sheds light is the spiel about being &ldquo;morphine-seeky.&rdquo; I have
come to find that very important to my views, or at least to be a good way of articulating
them. It&rsquo;s pretty much pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir-Whorf_Hypothesis">Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</a> stuff: the way that you describe the
world has a feedback loop with how you percieve the world and how you act on those descriptions and
perceptions (notice again the connection to the book&rsquo;s themes about constructing meaning). This is
why I bristle when someone uses the shorthand &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; for anyone (in practice, anyone brown) who
is in the United States for an extended period of time without having gone through the
Wagner-length tragedy that is our immigration bureaucracy. &ldquo;Illegal&rdquo; is a noun that obliterates the
actual person&mdash;and a certain political persuasion likes little better than an excuse to do
violence to the person of immigrants or suspected immigrants.</p>

<p>It is also a good principle to keep in mind when we describe one another. I share a community, the
furry subculture, with a lot of people with mental health problems. We have a bit more practice at
dealing with the problem of integrating everyone in the community healthily, but we are just
people, and so we fail as often as anyone else at coping. One of the pole-stars for me in this
situation is Root&rsquo;s advice: adjectives, not nouns. Don&rsquo;t reduce people to their disabilities, their
tropes, their health problems, their kinks, their politics, or to the last thing they did that hurt
your feelings.</p>

<p>Of course it is also a good guideline for life in general: if you are reducing people to
conveniently dumbed-down nouns, you are refusing to acknowledge their full personhood. This is a
reliable way to rationalize harmful behavior. I buy into the notion that one of the roots of evil
is treating people as means to an end, rather than as ends in themselves&mdash;as fully realized beings
with their own aspirations, plans, and flaws. There is no simplification of a person that stands up
to great scrutiny, that works in the general case.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of all the people, Ben Bernanke saying this!</p>

<blockquote><p>We have been taught that meritocratic institutions and societies are fair. Putting aside the
reality that no system, including our own, is really entirely meritocratic, meritocracies may be
fairer and more efficient than some alternatives. But fair in an absolute sense? Think about
it. A meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their health and
genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income;
luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways
difficult to enumerate&mdash;these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. <strong>The only way for
even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those
who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard,
to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>That is a deeply surprising and encouraging thing to hear one of the mascots of capitalism
saying. It is perhaps the case that saying this mostly accomplishes making him and the rich white
(mostly) kids he&rsquo;s addressing feel good about themselves. But it is still a true thing said
straightforwardly and firmly, and I applaud that.</p>

<p>Speaking of cinema: <em>Mirrormask</em> was quite a thing. For one thing, giving Dave McKean millions of
dollars to make a movie results in visual deliciousness. For another thing, looking back, I see
this prefiguring a bunch of my friends' kinks. Hello clockwork robot mind-control scene with a hint

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>There were darker resonances, too. People went to the movies to lose track of time; this video
would pound viewers with an awareness of how long they‚Äôd been languishing in the dark. It would
evoke the laziest of modern pleasures‚Äîchannel surfing‚Äîexcept that the time wasted would be
painfully underlined.</p>

<p>He would not be creating the first film with a running time of precisely one day. That
distinction went to <strong>24 Hour Psycho</strong>, a 1993 work, by Douglas Gordon, that stretched
Hitchcock‚Äôs taut thriller into excruciatingly portentous art. And Andy Warhol, in his 1964 film
‚ÄúEmpire‚Äù‚Äîeight hours of stationary footage of the Empire State Building fading into darkness‚Äîhad
created a work whose point was to make viewers &ldquo;see time go by.&rdquo; There was a lineage of
avant-garde cinema that, with varying degrees of obscurity, examined the temporal qualities of
film. Marclay‚Äôs contribution to the cinema of duration, though, would be pleasurable to watch. He
sensed a creepy challenge. If his film was sufficiently seductive, he might coax people to sit
for hours, literally watching their lives tick away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Christian Marclay&rsquo;s <em>The Clock</em> is also something I&rsquo;d quite like to see. It sometimes feels strange
to me, wanting to see movies even though I probably won&rsquo;t see them. <em>The Clock</em> draws me
particularly because it&rsquo;s about the artifice of cinema, the way it gets into Picasso-style
lies-that-tell-truths&mdash;a subject that&rsquo;s grown on me over the years. Maybe I am okay with movies
and I just dislike theatres? At any rate it might be time to reconsider my stance that video is
just not a good match for me. I am not particularly sad to be wrong: people exceeding expectations
is a cause for celebration.</p>

<p>As a side note, the New Yorker seems to be a big fan of <em>The Clock</em>: there&rsquo;s also
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/03/night-shift-with-the-clock.html">Night shift with The Clock</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2012/07/is-the-clock-worth-the-time.html">Is The Clock worth the time?</a>&rdquo; which
are both decent (and much shorter) reads, as well as
<a href="http://kottke.org/13/06/about-an-hour-of-christian-marclays-the-clock">Kottke&rsquo;s roundup of bootlegged clips</a> from the movie, which for obvious reasons is shown
as an installation and not available for purchase.</p>

<p>Werner Herzog and Errol Morris are collaborating on a documentary! I mean, that right there and I&rsquo;m
pretty much sold (although they are both in producer roles, not directing, but those two together
is a hell of a recommendation). Even if I wasn&rsquo;t, the story of <em>The Act Of Killing</em> (and isn&rsquo;t that
one hell of a name?) is compelling:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the government of Indonesia was overthrown by the military in 1965, Anwar and his friends
were promoted from small-time gangsters who sold movie theatre tickets on the black market to
death squad leaders. They helped the army kill more than one million alleged communists, ethnic
Chinese, and intellectuals in less than a year. As the executioner for the most notorious death
squad in his city, Anwar himself killed hundreds of people with his own hands. [&hellip;] Anwar and
his friends agree to tell us the story of the killings. But their idea of being in a movie is not
to provide testimony for a documentary: they want to star in the kind of films they most love
from their days scalping tickets at the cinemas. [And so] we challenge Anwar and his friends to
develop fiction scenes about their experience of the killings, adapted to their favorite genres:
gangster, western, musical. They write the scripts. They play themselves. And they play their
victims.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one hell of a premise, and the trailer is great. I want to see this so badly.</p>

<p>As an aside, this also provides even more of an illustration of how awful, awful, <strong><em>awful</em></strong> Mark
Millar&rsquo;s supremely shitty and soul-of-the-world-impoverishing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted_%28comics%29">Wanted</a> was and how Millar should live in
shame for having created it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today, Anwar is revered as a founding father of a right-wing paramilitary organization that grew
out of the death squads. The organization is so powerful that its leaders include government
ministers, and they are happy to boast about everything from corruption and election rigging to
acts of genocide. <strong>The Act Of Killing</strong> is about killers who have won, and the sort of society
they have built. Unlike ageing Nazis or Rwandan g√©nocidaires, Anwar and his friends have not been
forced by history to admit they participated in crimes against humanity. Instead, they have
written their own triumphant history, becoming role models for millions of young paramilitaries.
<strong>The Act of Killing</strong> is a journey into the memories and imaginations of the perpetrators,
offering insight into the minds of mass killers. And <strong>The Act of Killing</strong> is a nightmarish
vision of a frighteningly banal culture of impunity in which killers can joke about crimes
against humanity on television chat shows, and celebrate moral disaster with the ease and grace
of a soft shoe dance number.</p></blockquote>

<p>You want to challenge people&rsquo;s perceptions of good and evil through a &ldquo;bad guys win&rdquo; scenario?
That&rsquo;s how you fucking do it. Jesus, Mark Millar is such a hack.</p>

<p>This is a nifty video of a musical robot&mdash;but it&rsquo;s also a great example of how all culture builds
on what came before, how all culture is to some extent remix culture. It&rsquo;s a robot that physically
plays a set of instruments that correspond to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808">TR-808</a>, which itself was a way of synthetically
producing the sounds of that set of instruments. Always we are consuming what came before;
sometimes we are making it our own and new, and ideally we are giving it freely to a future that
needs it just as badly as we need our own past.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>To-day we have naming of parts. Yesterday, <br>
We had daily cleaning. And to-morrow morning, <br>
We shall have what to do after firing. But to-day, <br>
To-day we have naming of parts. Japonica <br>
Glistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to-day we have naming of parts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Life goes on even during its painful parts, even during the parts where routine is made to seem
ridiculous by the way in which it fails to address tragedy, heartbreak, loss. Life goes on and so
do we: routine is for reminding us of the onward force of time, which is indifferent to us and our
pain. We go on, we are swept on, we stumble on.</p>

<blockquote><p>Henry Reed&rsquo;s much-anthologized poem of World War II, &ldquo;Naming of Parts,&rdquo; concerns a British
sergeant-instructor delivering a lecture to his green recruits on the various parts of a
rifle. The progression of these lessons is as amusing as they are impeccably English: beginning
with proper cleaning of the weapon; succeeded by the grocery-list naming of parts; to be followed
the next day by &lsquo;what to do after firing.&rsquo; Conspicuously missing is a lesson in actual firing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Henry Reed&rsquo;s poem resonates in my head comparing the routine and the ridiculous and today we have
naming of parts. Poetry is a way of giving our expression different limits like an epiphyte vine
entangled with a cherry tree. Relationships are differently percieved and we may extract value from
the juxtaposition, which in my case I have not got. Relationships are differently percieved with
time and personhood and pain and abrupt changes of topic and today we have naming of parts.</p>

<p>We also have
<a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/015099.html#1341167">a satire of the poem</a> pointing
out the foibles of Wikipedia. The words are fragile and motionless, incompletely reflecting pain
and the fullness of the human experience, never letting anyone see any of them shed a tear.</p>

<p>Today we have naming of parts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good <a href="news:">news:</a> a judge pushing back against hate-your-sex-life obscenity laws!</p>

<p>Better <a href="news:">news:</a> by reading werewolf porn and deciding &ldquo;well that&rsquo;s not so bad&rdquo;!</p>

<p>The Atlantic Wire reports, in an article that you will not regret reading:</p>

<blockquote><p>Andres Martinez, serving time for attempted murder and robbery at the Secured Housing Unit at
Pelican Bay State Prison in California, is free to read his werewolf-human erotica novel,
according to a decision handed down by the First District Court of Appeal. [&hellip;] prison officials
confiscated the book, calling it obscene, because it contains sexually explicit passages and
&ldquo;advocates violence.&rdquo; [&hellip;] The case also pushes back on obscenity standards in its analysis of
the value of the overall text, making it more difficult to label a written work as obscene. In
short, more justices might have to read, think about, and write opinions on werewolf erotica.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am in favor of basically all of this, as a reader and writer of werewolf smut. :D</p>

<blockquote><p>here are some avatars i was commissioned to create for the gaymerconnect forums. a friend of mine
suggested that the existing avatars that users had to choose from all skewed male&mdash;androgynous
male, yeah, but as a trans woman she wasn‚Äôt comfortable wearing that as an avatar. so, i tried to
fill in the blanks with a bunch of feminine, femme and genderqueer identities.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really like where Pixelante went with this&mdash;this is some actual visual diversity here. Make sure
to check out the rest at the linked page!</p>

<p>Self-representation in digital media is an ongoing and open problem: I don&rsquo;t expect it to ever be
<em>solved</em> any more than the broader question of identity, but it&rsquo;s got an openness to
experimentation in ways that weren&rsquo;t possible before, and I find that very appealing. It&rsquo;s also
worked out very well for me personally: I wouldn&rsquo;t be the kitty I am if not for the potential
offered by digital media.</p>
